          <h2>Bigger Ambitions, Bigger Failure</h2>
          <div id="artBody">
            <p>In assessing the record of IT project failures over the past decade and detailed in the Risk Factor, one of the distressing recurring events are the massive cost blowouts as well as out-right cancellations of governmental IT modernization projects.  Over the past decade, governments at national and local levels have decided that needed to  consolidate a large number of disparate legacy IT systems—many 30 years old if not older—in order to improve operational functionality, effectiveness and efficiency, not to mention reduce the ever increasing maintenance costs.</p>

                /* global pym */
                var pymParent = new pym.Parent("complexity", "complexity.html", {});

            <p>The graph shows a sample of government modernization efforts that have gone awry and their complexity as represented by the number of legacy systems being consolidated into one overarching one. There are many more governmental IT failures that have been discussed in the Risk Factor, such as California’s, Florida’s and Pennsylvania’s slipshod attempts to update their unemployment systems. However, these efforts were aimed at replacing an existing IT system. In addition, there are no doubts many commercial modernization effort failures that have occurred over the past 10 years as well, but these are almost always cloaked in a shroud of commercial secrecy.  Only when a lawsuit is filed, such as when UK’s Centrica sued Accenture over a failed IT consolidation effort, is the shroud pulled back and a glimpse of what happened is seen. And even then, the full details are usually not disclosed.</p><p>As can be seen in the graph, IT modernization “success” is hard to achieve. The US Navy has been able to achieve its goal replacing 96 legacy IT systems with one, but at a development cost $300 million above its original $627 million estimate and three years later than scheduled. And that final cost does not include another $1 billion the Navy spent on four previous modernization pilots a decade ago that the U.S. Governmental Accountability Office audit report deemed wasteful failures.</p><p>Similarly, the IT modernization effort undertaken by the California Public Employees&#39; Retirement System (CalPers) also successfully eliminated 49 legacy systems, but the project overran its original $279 million cost estimate by $228 million as well as was more than two years late. In addition, its operation was so poor after it went live in 2011, that another $79 million has been spent trying to make the system work acceptably for its users.</p><p>British Columbia government has been proudly touting that its new CN $182 million modernization of its social welfare support systems was performed on time and within budget last year. However, as the BC auditor pointed out, the Integrated Case Management (ICM) system was supposed to replace 56 aging legacy systems, but in fact, only fully replaced 17 systems and partially replaced 5 others. Furthermore, government users ICM have bitterly complained about its unreliability and poor usability. There is no word on when the 34 increasing aging legacy systems still being depended upon will be replaced, or how much the government will need to spend to make the system user friendly.</p><p>There also two outright failures on the graph: the California Court Management System (CCMS) and the California MyCalPays state payroll modernization efforts. The former was cancelled after burning through an estimated $556 million after being rolled out to just 6 of the states 58 county courts. The project was killed in 2012 after the state auditor estimated that it would cost at least $1.9 billion to complete the effort; a consultant’s report put the cost to complete at “only” $1.3 billion. The original cost estimate was around $260 million.</p><p>The California MyCalPays payroll project fiasco was actually a “two-fer” failure. The project started in 2004 with the objective of integrating 13 state payroll-related IT systems into one; the estimated cost was $132 million with the completion date June 2009. However, after spending $83.2 million and looking at spending at least $95 million more, the project was temporarily halted in January 2009 after prime contractor was fired for lack of progress. The project was re-scoped, with the total cost estimate increasing to $305 million in early 2010, and a completion date now set for September 2012. However, the project was canceled in early 2013 when the second contractor was fired, again for a lack of progress. By this time the estimated cost had ballooned to $373 million, and the state had spent a total of $260 million on trying to implement MyCalPays with little to show for its efforts. The latest word is that California is still contemplating what to do next.</p><p>Then there is a failure in progress. The Social Security Administration Disability Case Processing System (DCPS) started seven years ago with an intention to replace 54 component IT systems with one centralized system to speed up disability claims. The original estimate was that the DCPS would be functional by 2013 at a total cost of $381 million. Over $288 million was spent on the project  as of last year, when the program was halted for a total lack of progress and reset. At least another $170 million will likely be spent before DCPS becomes operational in 2017, if it isn’t canceled.</p><p>While it is hard to draw definitive lessons from a handful of programs, it is pretty clear that IT modernization efforts are fraught with risk, and have a near certainty that they will overrun their cost estimates by significant amounts. More data is required obviously, but trying to combine more than 50 government IT systems for less than $400 - 500 million is not very likely.  That doesn’t mean that governmental agencies and departments won’t keep trying anyway.</p>
