(A note of caution&mdash;no one really has an authoritative set of financials on ECSS. That was made clear in the US Senate investigation report, which expressed frustration and outrage that the Air Force couldn’t tell it what was spent on what, when it was spent, nor even what ECSS had planned to spend over time.
