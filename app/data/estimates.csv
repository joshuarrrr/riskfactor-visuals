The plan was to have a fully deployed system by 2012.

After some early re-planning exercises to reduce program risk, the project had a ""new"" start in May 2005.

(A note of caution&mdash;no one really has an authoritative set of financials on ECSS. That was made clear in the US Senate investigation report, which expressed frustration and outrage that the Air Force couldn’t tell it what was spent on what, when it was spent, nor even what ECSS had planned to spend over time. Various reports have conflicting data on estimated and spent costs.)",GAO-08-866 Air Force Asset Visibility http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08866.pdf; GAO-13-311 Defense Major Automated Information Systems www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-311,

The first piloted release of ECSS had problems with data quality, data conversion, interoperability and integration, usability, information assurance and requirements testability. As a result, program management decided to restructure ECSS to improve data quality, update the Oracle software to be used, increase the number of releases from three to four, as well as restructure how the program was being managed.

Yet even the increased cost and schedule estimates were optimistic: after spending over $1 billion, the Air Force <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Farchive.federaltimes.com%2Farticle%2F20121108%2FAGENCY05%2F311080003%2FAir-Force-cancels-failed-logistics-system-after-spending-1-billion&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVkhLoe8hlPTJc2tmt2Am5J63E0A"">admitted</a> that it would cost another $1 billion to get just 25% of the system’s planned capability.

With ECSS spinning out of control, it was officially cancelled in December 2012 at a cost of arond $1.1 billion. (Our final estimated timeline is necessarily rough; no one bothered to figure it out how long it would actually take once they saw how far behind the project already was. Eight more years would seem like a reasonable estimate given that they would be effectively starting over from scratch.)

Additionally, as the IDA report noted, bring up bad news required “courage.” 

Finally, who was held accountable for ECSS’s demise? No one as it turned out.

Up to another $100 million may be needed to fix the system completely, while $837 million will be needed to operate it for next 5 years; $91 million in salary overpayments are still outstanding. The estimate of total life cycle cost is at least $1.25 billion to as high as $1.35 billion. As of 31 May 2012, 200,000 processes were still being performed manually on 92,000 forms every two-week pay period by over 1000 Queensland Health payroll employees;  in order to make it work, the payroll system contains thousands of modifications and customizations, with some 130 manual workarounds being employed.

Some $5 million was spent by the inquiry that was set up to try to make sense of what happened.",,

Initial rollout was due in October 2007, with a final scheduled for October 2009.

The FiReControl project was reassessed, and a new estimate of £340 million was published. EADS is hired as the prime contractor in March 2007 to develop the IT system required; the contract could be worth up to £200 million over eight years.The initial roll-out is now set for October 2009, with a final completion date set for end of 2011.

The final “estimated” cost to complete in December 2010 was  £635 million with a rollout beginning sometime in 2012 and going through who knows when, and even that was iffy. They had already built the regional control centers and agreed long term leases which they are stuck paying for. ",,
