The original <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08866.pdf"">estimated life cycle cost</a> of ECSS is put at US $3 billion, with about $1.8 billion allocated to development and $1.2 billion for operations and maintenance. The plan is to fully deploy the system by 2012.

After some early replanning exercises to reduce program risk, the project has a “new start” in May 2005.

(Note: No one has an authoritative set of financials on ECSS. That was made clear in the U.S. Senate investigation report, which expressed frustration and outrage that the Air Force couldn’t tell it what was spent on what, when it was spent, nor even what ECSS had planned to spend over time. Various reports have conflicting data on estimated and spent costs.)",GAO-08-866 Air Force Asset Visibility http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08866.pdf; GAO-13-311 Defense Major Automated Information Systems www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-311,,

In early 2006, the U.S. Air Force also pays Oracle $90 million to license the software that the system is to be built with.

The intended capabilities of ECSS are still a bit of a mystery. At this time, the Air Force, in two conflicting statements, says that ECSS is going to both replace “more than 400 legacy systems” as well as “over 700 legacy systems.”",Expeditionary Combat Support System: Root Cause Analysis (See Figure 3) www.acq.osd.mil/parca/docs/2011-ida-rca-ecss-p-4732.pdf,,

At the same time, the report also notes that the U.S. Air Force acknowledges that the program is going to overrun that amount, because functionality that was supposed to go into the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) project is now to be merged into ECSS. The number of legacy systems that are going to be replaced starts to drop, with 250 being the number bandied about (although “more than 400 legacy systems” continues to appear in Air Force literature).

The DEAMS project, beginning in 2003, aimed to replace nine Air Force legacy accounting systems at an estimated life cycle cost of $420 million by October 2009. It is now scheduled to be completed in April 2017 at a projected life cycle cost of $2.2 billion.",Expeditionary Combat Support System: Root Cause Analysis (See Figure 3) www.acq.osd.mil/parca/docs/2011-ida-rca-ecss-p-4732.pdf,,

The first piloted release of ECSS has problems with data quality, data conversion, interoperability and integration, usability, information assurance, and requirements testability.

At the present time, an <a href=""http://archive.federaltimes.com/article/20140117/MGMT/301170009/Air-Force-tries-again-logistics-modernization"">ECSS replacement is being planned</a>, but the Air Force isn’t saying how much it will cost, how legacy systems will be replaced, and when it is expected to be operational, although it is promising it will <a href=""http://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2013/02/05/air-force-hopes-it-overhaul-takes-wing/"">cost less</a> than ECSS.

Why did ECSS fail? Three publicly available reports (from <a href=""http://www.acq.osd.mil/parca/docs/2011-ida-rca-ecss-p-4732.pdf"">IDA</a> [PDF], <a href=""http://www.acq.osd.mil/parca/docs/2013-08-28-parca-rca-ecss.pdf"">the Air Force</a> [PDF], and <a href=""http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/download/report_-air-forces-expeditionary-combat-support-system-ecss-program"">the Senate</a> [PDF]) provide a host of reasons, but management incompetence coupled with excessive hubris and a desire not to hear negative news probably captures 95 percent of it. While promising to learn the lessons from previous similar large-scale IT failures, Air Force management not only studiously ignored them but seemed to willfully defy them.

So who is being held accountable for ECSS’s demise? No one, as it turns out. The Air Force’s senior leadership has made it crystal clear that firing or demoting anyone for blowing $1 billion on an absolutely useless IT system is “<a href=""http://archive.defensenews.com/article/20121203/C4ISR01/312030011/How-USAF-Blew-1B-Logistics-System"">not necessary</a>.”",GAO-13-311 Defense Major Automated Information Systems www.gao.gov/products/GAO-13-311,yes,
