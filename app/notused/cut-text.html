            <!--  <p>Ten years ago, <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> published the"<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/why-software-fails">Why Software Fails</a>," an article that examined the underlying causes of notable project failures. A couple years later, we started the Risk Factor blog, with the goal of tracking technology failures both large and small.</p>
            <p>Now we've decided to take a step back and look at the big picture, by combing through the archives. We've hand-selected some of the most interesting failures from each month of the decade and assembled a rogue's-gallery of good technological intentions gone bad.</p> -->

             <!-- <div class="totals-intro">
              <p>Not all failures can be measured the same way. Some, like failed upgrades or modernization projects have straightforward financial consequences. Others, like system outages and failures make their impact felt by wasted time and productivity. In the sums above, we've only included stories in which a quantified impact was readily available.</p>

 <!-- <p>The past ten years has seen a plethora of IT failures, running from contract cancellations (e.g., the UK government’s decision in 2010 to scrap its National Identity Register project after spending some  £257 million on it) to major project delays and cost overruns (e.g.,  the 2009 roll-out of Melbourne, Australia’s Myki transportation ticketing system that was two years plus late and AU$700 million over budget) to operational failures (e.g., US Airways reservation system meltdown in 2007). </p> -->

            <p>There are a number of major IT projects that will prove interesting to watch in the future. These include Australia’s AU$1.5 billion plan to modernize its welfare payments system, New Zealand’s $1 billion tax system modernization, and the US $7 billion effort to implement a national broadband network for first responders. FirstNet chairwoman Susan Swenson stated, “We should be shot,” if system isn&#39;t working by as planned by 2022. Let’s say we hold her to that, eh?</p>
