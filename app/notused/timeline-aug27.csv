The configuration change was made as part of a “performance update” to Azure Storage, that when made, exposed the bug, and “resulted in reduced capacity across services utilizing Azure Storage, including Virtual Machines, Visual Studio Online, Websites, Search and other Microsoft services.” The bug, which had escaped detection during “several weeks of testing,” caused the storage Blob Front-Ends to go into an infinite loop, Zander stated. However, the Blob Front-Ends needed a restart to halt their infinite looping, which slowed the recovery time, Zander wrote.

The effects of the bug could have been contained, except that Zander indicated someone apparently didn’t follow standard procedure in rolling out the performance update.

“Unfortunately the issue was wide spread, since the update was made across most regions in a short period of time due to operational error, instead of following the standard protocol of applying production changes in incremental batches.”",,Microsoft,system outage/crash,"Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,IT,,,Microsoft,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,Impact - hours"

Australian Transport Safety Bureau's director of aviation safety investigation, Julian Walsh said that, ""Because of the fault â'¿ [the component] has indicated to the flight control computer that the angle of attack of the aircraft was higher.""

OPB quoted CenturyLink spokesperson Martin Flynn as saying that “a computer card was removed from CenturyLink’s master controller, the unit stopped responding and needed to be reset.”

In Washington State, the AP reported that CenturyLink blamed the outage on an unspecified “technical error by a third-party vendor” that was “not related to CenturyLink's network.” A story in the Tacoma News Tribune reported that state emergency officials told the paper that the “outage apparently stemmed from a malfunction in the telephone networks that people use to make everyday calls, not the separate system that sends calls to emergency dispatchers.” . The outage was subsequently blamed on a 911 system upgrade by AT&T. A story at The Province states that the ICBC blamed the mistake on its on-going migration that began in 2006 from a 40-year old legacy computer system to a new CAD$400 million system which is scheduled to be completed in 2015.
