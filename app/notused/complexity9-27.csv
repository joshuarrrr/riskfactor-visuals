British Columbia’s Integrated Case Management system,"The government of British Columbia, Canada, has been proudly touting that the new CA $182 million modernization of its social welfare support systems was performed on time and within budget last year. However, the Integrated Case Management (ICM) system that was supposed to replace 56 aging legacy systems fully replaced only 17 systems and partially replaced 5 others. Furthermore, government users of ICM have bitterly complained about its unreliability and poor usability. There is no word on when the other 34 legacy systems will be replaced or how much improved usability will cost.",http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/british-columbias-integrated-case-management-system-falls-over,CA $,start,56,182000000,0.9177,167021400,3/1/2008,11/1/2014

California's Court Management System,The California Court Management System (CCMS) was canceled after burning through an estimated $556 million since its rollout to just 6 of 58 county courts. The project was killed in 2012 after the state auditor estimated that it would cost at least $1.9 billion to complete the effort; a consultant’s report put the cost to complete at “only” $1.3 billion. The original cost estimate was around $260 million.,http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Computer-system-dropped-after-500-million-spent-3450186.php,US $,start,58,260000000,1,260000000,7/1/2002,6/1/2013

California's MyCalPays payroll modernization project,"The California MyCalPays state payroll modernization fiasco was actually two failures for the price of one. The project started in 2004 with the objective of integrating 13 state-payroll-related IT systems into one; the estimated cost was $132 million with a completion date of June 2009. However, after the state spent $83.2 million and looking at spending at least $95 million more, the project was temporarily halted in January 2009 after the prime contractor was fired for lack of progress. The project was rescoped, with the total cost estimate increasing to $305 million in early 2010 and a completion date set for September 2012. The project was finally canceled in early 2013 when the second contractor was fired. By this time the estimated cost had ballooned to $373 million, and the state had spent a total of $260 million.",http://www.lao.ca.gov/Recommendations/Details/761,US $,start contract 1,13,132000000,1,132000000,5/1/2004,6/1/2009

California's CalPERS benefits management system,"The IT modernization effort undertaken by the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) successfully eliminated 49 legacy systems, but the project overran its original $279 million cost estimate by $228 million and was more than two years late. In addition, its operation was so poor after it went live in 2011 that another $79 million has been spent trying to improve the system for its users.",http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/02/shedding-some-light-on-foreign.html,US $,start,49,279000000,1,279000000,5/1/2005,4/1/2010

US Social Security Administration's Disability Case Processing System,"The Social Security Administration Disability Case Processing System (DCPS) is a failure in progress. It started seven years ago and was intended to replace 54 component IT systems with one centralized system. DCPS was supposed to be functional by 2013 at a total cost of $381 million. More than $288 million has been spent on the project as of 2014, when the program was halted and reset. At least another $170 million will likely be spent before DCPS becomes operational in 2017—if it isn’t canceled.",http://oig.ssa.gov/sites/default/files/audit/full/pdf/A-14-15-15016.pdf,US $,start,54,381000000,1,381000000,10/1/2008,9/1/2013

UK’s FiReControl project,"FiReControl aimed to replace 46 local control rooms with a network of nine purpose-built regional control centers, which would use a national computer system to handle calls, mobilize equipment, and manage incidents. The project was terminated after £250 million has been spent. There were another £219 million in already committed costs, bumping the total spending to £469 million. Except for the regional center used by the London Fire Brigade, the other eight centers are empty and are likely to remain so.",http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/uk-firecontrol-it-project-one-of-the-worst-ever,£,start,46,120000000,1.6066,192792000,4/1/2004,10/1/2009
