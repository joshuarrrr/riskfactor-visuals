      <div class="sumtext">While we know what the problem is, and have a potential solution, we are having to carefully consider how and when we apply this, to avoid further problems.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">Unfortunately, the métro&rsquo;s main computer system shut itself down before the engineers did as the &ldquo;<span class="cause">server gave bad data to the system and saturated the memory</span>&rdquo; of the computer.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">So when problems were reported to the LAUSD IT department, it wasn&rsquo;t clear how many were true technical problems versus user-unfamiliarity problems.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">During the first days of the computer failure in June, the station's atmosphere control system seized up.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">Using the cables did expose the computers to damage from real power surges, but by then the power system had settled into a benign and steady state.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">The NYSE has been having a bad run of IT problems the past few weeks since it completed in June <span class="cause">a computer system upgrade</span> that allowed the exchange to process trades in 5 milliseconds.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">The company is <span class="cause">still trying to determine</span> what caused the problem.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">There was <span class="cause">no reason give</span>n for why the New Skies system crashed.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">It is suspected that this is the cause for the current problem as well.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">I suspect there was a computer system upgrade or maintenance fix in late July or early August that wasn't fully tested out.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">Continuing to blame the problem on <span class="cause">training</span> is a rather lame excuse.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">The exact problem with the server has not been announced, and as of yet there is nothing on the NYSE web site discussing the outage.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">The initial assumption was that <span class="cause">some external interference, such as noise on the power supply</span>, was responsible for generating false commands inside the computer system.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">The problem remains <span class="cause">unsolved</span> as of today.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">The problem remains unsolved as of today.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">The governor still insisted, however, that a major problem was <span class="cause">training</span>, which had been ""underestimated.""</div>

      <div class="sumtext">GM says it doesn&rsquo;t know of any crashes that are linked to this problem, either.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">The Times also says the company, ""<span class="cause">couldn't explain</span> why the problem was happening or why it hadn't been resolved.""</div>

      <div class="sumtext">Analysis teams still had to determine why the computers failed, and why the jumper cables seemed to fix the problem.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">Apparently , <span class="cause">"a crew member entered an incorrect figure"</span> into the electronic flight bag, a laptop computer which provides data to the aircraft's electronic flight control system." <span class="effect">An United Emirates aircraft struck its tail on the runway three times and a grassy area twice before being able to ascend. The aircraft sustained substantial damage as well as damaged some airport lighting and the airport's instrument landing system.</span></div>

      <div class="sumtext">Greifeld did darkly hint, however, that the problems were <span class="cause">someone else&rsquo;s fault</span> .</div>

      <div class="sumtext">Still, my instinct is to attribute the problem to a more prosaic explanation.</div>

      <div class="sumtext">BA put out another press release blaming international airline security rules for bags being opened as well as being delayed, and further promised to look into the ransacking claims.</div>
