<!--  <p>While it is hard to draw definitive lessons from a handful of programs, it is pretty clear that IT modernization efforts are fraught with risk, and have a near certainty that they will overrun their cost estimates by significant amounts. More data is required obviously, but trying to combine more than 50 government IT systems for less than $400 - 500 million is not very likely.  That doesn’t mean that governmental agencies and departments won’t keep trying anyway.</p> -->

<!--             <p>Many modernization projects never bother to count or specify the number of legacy systems to be replaced. Even when they do, "systems" is a loosely defined term, which can include everything from a simple spreadsheet to a full financial processing system. Still, you'd think it's important to know what exactly you're replacing. In the notorious ECSS project, the people involved couldn't even seem to settle on a single number. Below, we've charted all the different numbers provided in official sources.</p> -->
