2005-02-01T07:00:00Z,UK National Air Traffic Control System Crashes, Flight delays ,,,1,hours,1,,,,,UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/1857231/more-failures-nats-west-drayton-control-centre,,More system failures at Nats' West Drayton control centre,"A National Air Traffic Services' (Nats) system failure resulted in delays at airports across the UK last night.

Nats identified a fault with its flight data processing (FDP) system at its West Drayton control centre at 6.30pm last night, which it managed to correct by 7.03pm.

At this stage, the cause of the fault is not known but is being investigated.

During that time, flight control operations were handled manually, while Nats imposed restrictions on the number of inbound aircraft entering UK airspace and those taking off from local airports.

At London's Heathrow airport, passengers suffered average delays of an hour on all domestic and international flights.

This is the second computer failure at West Drayton in less than a year.

On June 3rd, 2004, a failed FDP system upgrade at the centre caused widespread and extensive delays to flights across the UK.

Similar system failures also occurred at the same centre in 2002 and 2000.

Nats is currently investing £1bn over the next 10 years to modernise every aspect of its systems.

The wide-ranging programme includes about 340 separate projects.

It aims to renew and upgrade all radar facilities, consolidate four centres into two, develop a new FDP system in collaboration with European partners, and improve communications links between all sites in the UK.

The most important component of the project is the new FDP system, likely to be developed in conjunction with Spain and Germany.

Last month, the air traffic controller commissioned a study into the technical and regulatory implications of sharing control of airspace with the Irish Aviation Authority.","UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,airport/port/customs/systems"
2005-03-01T07:00:00Z,Hudson Bay Co. ERP System Problems Contribute to Losses,$10 Million ,,,,,,,1.0E7,$,CAD,Canada,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,http://www.itbusiness.ca/news/hudsons-bay-cio-explains-big-ticket-it-problems/7791,,Hudson’s Bay CIO explains ‘big ticket’ IT problems,"An IT project that cost Hudson’s Bay Co. millions in lost revenue was a year past its original deadline and caused delivery delays for customers, according to the company’s CIO.

HBC, operator of The Bay and Zellers stores,



finally launched its “big ticket” system in March of this year. The project, which required changes to almost every aspect of the company’s IT infrastructure, caused a loss of approximately $10-million in sales and revenue. The loss was highlighted in the company’s first quarter financial results report, which was released last month. The report also said that most of those sales could be recovered in the following quarter.

“It’s a massive change and as with any change in people, process and technology you always run some degree of risk,” said CIO Gary Davenport. “We took all kinds of steps you typically take in projects to mitigate risks, but given the magnitude of the change . . . we certainly ended up having more problems than we wanted.”

HBC began its transition to “big ticket” – large in-store items like furniture and appliances – several years ago. The company has pursued an aggressive overhaul of its IT systems for more than half a decade and convened a partnership of some of the world’s largest technology vendors to help out. Microsoft, IBM and Oracle formed the backbone of the partnership and have collaborated on several occasions to help HBC revitalize its infrastructure.

The “big ticket” piece replaced a 32-year-old paper-based system and was designed to be “much more real-time and immediate in terms of servicing the needs of our customers,” said Davenport. It included components from HBC’s regular technology partners.

Davenport didn’t elaborate on how or why the project slipped out of control, but said that delivery times of big ticket items were affected and customers experienced delays. Those delays contributed to the $10 million in lost sales. “If you push your deliveries out of one month into the next you impact the sales you can declare,” he explained.

HBC’s delivery partner TNT N.V., a logistics organization that operates in dozens of countries, did not return calls for comment at press time.

“Part of the issue is, as projects get bigger it’s harder to manage them,” said Rena Granofsky, an analyst at retail consulting firm, the J.C. Williams Group . “With large players sometimes it just becomes more complex and more difficult to manage. This must have been an especially large project.”

Davenport said that additional testing may have helped, but the tremendous scope of the project meant that the company couldn’t afford to be too reticent about its implementation. “This is a type of system you can’t just phase in,” he said. “It has to be all in at the same time.”

HBC and its technology partners are currently “taking steps” to fix any problems that are still outstanding. “I don’t think there’s a lot of finger-pointing going on. The importance is to resolve the situation and make sure we’re meeting the needs of our customers,” said Davenport.

Hudson’s Bay isn’t alone when it comes to IT projects whose reach exceeded their grasp. In 2001, Sobeys Inc. infamously split with its partner SAP. The food retailer claimed that SAP’s enterprise software failed to meet its ordering and processing needs for stores in Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Sobeys pulled the plug on the ERP system one year after it was initially implemented.

“The problem with some retailers is they’re always looking for the huge project to solve their problems,” said a retail analyst who asked to remain anonymous for the purposes of this story. “There is a point at which projects become unmanageable. The Bay has a talent for it. (The big ticket system) was the showcase project that was going to give them faster delivery, more reliable systems and lower costs.”

Davenport said that HBC is setting its sites on other major projects. In three months it will take the wraps off a “merchandise continuum project” which will allow a single view of the data generated by its three properties – The Bay, Zellers and Home Outfitters – allowing the stores to share efficiencies and all carry top-selling items.

Granofsky said that HBC’s big ticket implementation is a blemish on its record, but the company is still regarded as leader in retail technology. “There are always challenges and they’re still out there innovating,” she said.

HBC’s broad-ranging goals are all designed to improve what Davenport calls “information systems agility. . . . You’ve got millions of transactions, thousands of customers and low margins, so (there’s) little room for error.”","Canada,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,ERP"
2005-03-01T07:00:00Z,FBI Cancels Virtual Case File System, $170 Million ,,,,,,,1.7E8,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,http://www.computerworld.com/article/2569344/app-development/fbi-scuttles--170m-system-for-managing-investigations.html,,FBI Scuttles $170M System for Managing Investigations,"The FBI has officially scrapped a troubled $170 million IT project in which it was developing a new case-management system designed partly to help its agents investigate terrorism. And the agency expects that it will take more than three years to implement a replacement system.

FBI Director Robert Mueller announced during testimony before a subcommittee of the U.S. House Appropriations Committee last week that the Virtual Case File system is being shelved. The fate of the 4-year-old project had been in doubt since January, when the FBI said it was looking at alternative approaches .

""I am disappointed that we did not come through with Virtual Case File,"" Mueller told the House subcommittee. But he added that he sees the decision as an opportunity to develop a more up-to-date system that will use mostly off-the-shelf software and let FBI agents share information about cases more easily.

An FBI official who asked that she not be identified said the agency has already begun evaluating commercial products to see if they fit its IT needs. She said FBI officials expect to complete the evaluation and set ""a more firm direction"" by late this month.

The House Appropriations Committee said it's opening a formal investigation into why the Virtual Case File project failed. Last month, a U.S. Department of Justice audit criticized the FBI's efforts to develop the system, which was supposed to replace an antiquated system, according to the audit.

The Virtual Case File software was commissioned from San Diego-based Science Applications International Corp. in mid-2001 and was originally due to be deployed by the end of 2003. But development was delayed, and SAIC didn't deliver an initial version of the system until last December.

In addition to evaluating off-the-shelf software, the FBI is conducting a prototype test of SAIC's most recent software delivery, according to the agency official who asked to remain anonymous. The technology that was presented to the FBI by SAIC wasn't meeting the requirements that had been set forth, ""so we needed to evaluate what they had given us as far as user capability and usability,"" she said.

SAIC spokesman Jared Adams argued that the FBI hasn't formally killed off the Virtual Case File project and pointed to the ongoing tests as proof that a final decision has not yet been made. ""When the tests are done at the end of March, I think then a decision will be made,"" he said.

But the FBI official said the agency is incorporating lessons learned from the failed project and moving forward. For instance, the agency has created an enterprise architecture with overarching standards for both custom and packaged applications.

Mueller said the new case management system, which won't be called Virtual Case File, will be installed in four phases and should take approximately 39 months to complete. He declined to estimate how much the system will cost.","US,Project Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,FBI VCF/Sentinel"
2005-05-01T07:00:00Z,Software bug causes 2004-2005 Toyota Prius to stall," 20,000 cars recalled ",20000,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/18/business/fi-cars18,,Prius Glitches Highlight Problems of Car Computers,"Prius Glitches Highlight Problems of Car Computers

And the systems are complex: Software for the average car can have more than 35 million lines of code, 100 times or more the code needed for a full-color, action- and sound-packed interactive computer game.

The typical passenger car has 70 or more tiny but powerful computers onboard that control audio systems, air conditioning, brakes, air bags and other functions.

The software glitch that caused some Toyota Prius hybrids to suddenly stall casts a spotlight on a broader problem: Cars have computers, lots of them, and computers can crash.

The fuel-efficient hybrids, which need to control separate gasoline and electric power sources, are even more complex. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week said it had received 13 complaints of Priuses stalling or stopping for no apparent reason, sometimes at high speed. Toyota Motor Corp. said the problem stemmed from a software bug in the computer system.

There also have been consumer complaints about Mazda Motor Corp.'s new RX-8 sports car. The software controlling fuel injection was flooding the engine -- but only in cold-weather states.

""Every car company is doing regular updates of its operating software"" to get rid of glitches, said Mazda spokesman Jeremy Barnes. Mazda developed a software fix for the RX-8 that has been installed in about 3,000 vehicles.

""I wouldn't be surprised if every single carmaker hasn't had an electronics issue with every single model at some point,"" Barnes said.

Repair data seem to bear that out -- 32% of auto warranty claims in the U.S. are for software or electronics-related issues, Stefanis said.

BMW's iDrive, a sophisticated computerized joystick that controls lights, navigation, audio and scores of other components, was plagued by software glitches when it debuted in 2002. BMW had to install numerous upgrades to get the system working smoothly.

DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz line has also experienced electronics bugs. As a result, the German carmaker's reliability ratings have fallen dramatically in recent years, with Mercedes getting bad reviews for its electrical problems in Consumer Reports' surveys.

Some owners of late-model Mercedes-Benz E-Class cars have complained online recently about software glitches affecting their electronically controlled automatic transmissions.

Mercedes has acknowledged the problems, but like other carmakers it points out that automotive computers must work in conditions that would send the typical laptop or desktop computer into meltdown. The systems are jolted in rear-end freeway crashes, bounced over potholes at 60 mph and subject to extreme heat as well as extreme cold.

""We probably should be shocked that there are so few problems"" with electronics, said Kevin Smith, editorial director of Edmunds.com. A chat room on the automotive information site was home to a string of complaints that first drew attention to the Prius' stalling problem in some 2004 and 2005 models.

Toyota said it would collect data on the problems to see whether there was something that could lead to a fix.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - units recalled,Toyota"
2005-06-01T07:00:00Z,United Airlines finally abandons the automated baggage-handling system at Denver International Airport,Over $186 Million wasted,,,,,,,1.86E8,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/27/national/27denver.html?pagewanted=all.&_r=0,,Denver Airport Saw the Future. It Didn't Work.,"DENVER, Aug. 26 - Ten years ago, the new Denver International Airport marched boldly into the future with a computerized baggage-handling system that immediately became famous for its ability to mangle or misplace a good portion of everything that wandered into its path.

Now the book is closing on the brilliant machine that couldn't sort straight. Sometime over the next few weeks, in an anticlimactic moment marked and mourned by just about nobody, the only airline that ever used any part of the system will pull the plug. An episode bowing equally to John Henry, Rube Goldberg and Hal from ""2001"" will end.

People will be fully back in charge.

""Automation always looks good on paper,"" said Veronica Stevenson, a lead baggage handler for United Airlines and president of the union local that represents United's 1,300 or so baggage handlers in Denver. ""Sometimes you need real people.""

The handoff in baggage handling also illustrates how much has changed in airline economics since Denver's grandiose dream was envisioned in the early 1990's. Airlines that were flush then are struggling and looking for ways to save money now, as United will do by shutting down computerized baggage-moving.

Technology, too, has brought change. Back then, the big-brained mainframe doing it all from command central was the model of high tech. Today the very idea of it sounds like a cold-war-era relic, engineers say. Decentralization and mobile computing technology have taken over just about everything, allowing airlines, warehouse operators and shippers like FedEx to learn with just a few clicks the whereabouts of an item in motion, a feature that was supposed to be a chief strength of the baggage system.

The premise of Denver's plan was as big as the West. The distance from a centralized baggage check-in to the farthest gate -- about a mile -- dictated expansive new thinking, planners said, and technology would make the new airport a marvel. Travelers who arrived for check-in or stepped off a plane would have their bags whisked across the airport with minimal human intervention. The result would be fewer flight delays, less waiting at luggage carousels and big savings in airline labor costs.

Tours that preceded the system's debut led invariably to an airport basement where 26 miles of track, loaded with thousands of small gray carts, sped bags up and down inclines as conveyor belts minutely timed by the computer deposited each bag in its cart at just the right moment.

""They were so proud of it,"" said Raymond Neidl, an airline-aerospace analyst with Calyon Securities in New York. ""It's the one thing they wanted to show you.""

But then the price tag ballooned along with glitches. Construction costs of $186 million were compounded at a rate of $1 million a day for months in 1994 when the airport's opening was delayed by baggage-handling failures. Tens of millions more have been spent in the years since for repairs and modifications.

United, Denver's busiest airline, has been using a stripped-down, simplified version of the network for its outgoing flights since the airport opened in 1995 -- though ""enduring"" is probably the better word, since regular breakdowns have continued despite years of tinkering.

Automation never worked for incoming flights, whose baggage has been moved by handlers from the beginning. And no other airline ever tried to use the error-prone system at all.

United's general manager for customer service in Denver, Jim Kyte, says the pressure to cut costs as the airline struggles to emerge from bankruptcy, along with sharply rising fuel prices this year, ultimately forced the issue. Turning off the computer and reverting to the old-fashioned use of human beings who drive luggage carts from gate to gate -- the way things are still done at most airports -- will save $1 million a month in maintenance costs, which have far exceeded expectations.

The change might also bring new terms to a lease that now provides for United to pay the city, the automated system's owner, $60 million a year until 2025. Asked about the prospect of trying to renegotiate with Denver, a United spokesman, Jeff Green, said, ""We are reviewing all options.""

Those kinds of costs aside, the error rate among baggage handlers is lower than the befuddled computer could ever achieve, Mr. Kyte said. A test run this summer using workers to handle baggage for transfer flights through the airport has already proved its value, he said, with the number of mishandled bags down sharply in July from the corresponding month a year ago.

""We're going back to the future,"" Mr. Kyte said.

Workers with hand-held scanners, checking baggage bar codes at every juncture of transit, will give managers far better information and control than could have been imagined when the automated system was designed, officials at United said.

One expert who has studied the sad sack arc of baggage movement in Denver said the designers had invested too much belief in the wizardry they thought was at their command.

""It wasn't the technology per se, it was a misplaced faith in it,"" said Richard de Neufville, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and engineering systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Professor de Neufville said the builders had imagined that their creation would work well even at the busiest boundaries of its capacity. That left no room for the errors and inefficiencies that are inevitable in a complex enterprise.

""The main culprit was hubris,"" he said.

Sharp corners, for example, were too much for the system to deal with. The whirring baggage carts, programmed to pick up and drop off bags in a perfectly coordinated ballet, often just tipped over and dumped their loads.

Then there was the lizard tongue, formally known as a telescoping belt loader, which was designed to shoot out from the track system's maw directly to an airplane's luggage doors. It, too, was a flop.

BAE Automated Systems of Carrollton, Tex., which designed the system, has since been liquidated, and no one associated with the effort could be reached for comment.

The abandonment of computerized baggage transit is hardly the only step that United has taken to cut costs. The airline, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002, has repeatedly asked employees to share the pain, and many current and former workers could lose some pension benefits. Even the death of the automated system is not expected to result in additional jobs, since an increase in baggage handlers will be offset by a decline in the number of maintenance workers.

Industry analysts say recapturing and maintaining the good will of the workers will be crucial to the airline's ultimate recovery. ""If they can keep the peace,"" Mr. Neidl said, ""they have a chance of becoming a powerhouse in the industry again. If the employees declare war, the company will probably go the way of Pan Am.""

In any event, managers at the airport say the failure of big-thought baggage transit does have a plus: lots of room in the basement. Denver has 33 baggage scanners the size of minivans that, as required by federal security regulations in the wake of 9/11, screen every piece of luggage. No one envisioned those regulations when the airport was built, or imagined where such machines might be put.

""When the federal government mandated that airports screen all luggage, some airports had to set them up by the ticket areas,"" said Chuck Cannon, a spokesman for Denver International. ""We just took out some of the old system that had never become operational. We had the space.""","US,,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,airport/port/customs/systems"
2005-08-01T07:00:00Z,Virus Patch Takes Down US-Visit Border Screening System, Port of entry delays for a day ,,,1,days,24.0,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Customs,,http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/04/70642?currentPage=all,,Border Security System Left Open,"A computer failure that hobbled border-screening systems at airports across the country last August occurred after Homeland Security officials deliberately held back a security patch that would have protected the sensitive computers from a virus then sweeping the internet, according to documents obtained by Wired News.

The documents raise new questions about the $400 million US-VISIT program, a 2-year-old system aimed at securing the border from terrorists by gathering biometric information from visiting foreign nationals and comparing it against government watch lists.

The Aug. 18 computer failure led to long lines at international airports in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and elsewhere, while U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, officials processed foreign visitors by hand, or in some cases used backup computers, according to contemporaneous press reports.

Publicly, officials initially attributed the failure to a virus, but later reversed themselves and claimed the incident was a routine system failure.

But two CBP reports obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that the virulent Zotob internet worm infiltrated agency computers the day of the outage, prompting a hurried effort to patch hundreds of Windows-based US-VISIT workstations installed at nearly 300 airports, seaports and land border crossings around the country.

""When the virus problems appeared on (CBP) workstations Thursday evening, the decision was made to push the patch, immediately, to the ... US-VISIT workstations. Most workstations had received the patch by midnight and US-VISIT was back in operation at all locations,"" reads a CBP summary of the incident.

The Department of Homeland Security's US-VISIT program office declined to comment on the documents.

Former White House cybersecurity adviser Howard Schmidt says the incident is typical of a large agency struggling with complex networks and evolving threats. ""We've got catching-up to do in all areas, particularly areas having to do with national security and public safety,"" says Schmidt. ""I hope you and I, 10 years from now, look back and say, 'Wow, I'm glad we survived that.'""

Launched in January 2004, and expanded since then, US-VISIT is a hodgepodge of older databases maintained by various government agencies, tied to a national CBP-run network of Windows 2000 Professional workstations installed at U.S. points of entry. The system has processed more than 52 million visitors, and allowed border officials to intercept more than 1,000 wanted criminals and immigration violators, according to DHS. Some US-VISIT locations are now testing gear to read new RFID-equipped passports.

While the idea of US-VISIT is universally lauded within government, the program's implementation has faced a steady barrage of criticism from congressional auditors concerned over management issues and cybersecurity problems. Last December, the DHS inspector general reported that the program might be vulnerable to hackers.

The nearly 6-year-old Windows 2000 operating system was a particularly burdensome choice on Aug. 9, when Microsoft announced a vulnerability in the software's plug-and-play feature that allowed attackers to take complete control of a computer over a network. In an unusually quick mating of vulnerability with attack, it took only four days for a virus writer to launch an internet worm, called Zotob, that spread through the security hole.

Operating somewhat more slowly, it took CBP officials until Aug. 16 -- a full week after Microsoft released a patch for the hole -- to start pushing the fix to CBP's Windows 2000 computers. But because of the array of peripherals hanging off of the US-VISIT workstations -- fingerprint readers, digital cameras and passport scanners -- they held off longer on fixing those machines, for fear that the patch itself might cause a disruption.

""The push was not made to the US-VISIT workstations during the initial install due to concerns with the possible impact of the patch on the unique workstation configurations,"" reads one of the CBP reports.

Officials -- not unreasonably, say security experts -- wanted to test the patch before installing it. But as a consequence, hundreds of computers networked to sensitive law enforcement and intelligence databases were left with a known vulnerability -- a security hole rated ""critical"" by Microsoft because it allows attackers to take control of a machine remotely.

It wasn't until Zotob made itself at home on the CBP network Aug. 18 that the agency launched a fevered effort to secure the US-VISIT terminals, which sit on local area networks that are in turn connected to CBP's wide area network.

Even as officials raced to install the patches, the US-VISIT computers were failing at major U.S. entry points around the country, including airports in Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Laredo, Texas, according to press reports at the time.

A DHS spokesman told the Associated Press the next day that a virus caused the outages. But in December, a different DHS spokesman told CNET News.com that there was no evidence that a virus was responsible, and that it was merely one of the routine ""computer glitches"" one expects in any complex system.

The newly released documents call that claim into question.

The government did not part with the pages lightly. After an initial FOIA request was rebuffed, Wired News filed a federal lawsuit, represented by Megan Adams, a law student at the Stanford Law School Cyberlaw Clinic. Only then did CBP release six pages of heavily redacted documents, including one page that is completely blacked out. (The lawsuit is ongoing.)

The redactions leave it unclear whether the virus itself shuttered the system, or whether the patch, or the process of installing it, contributed to the outage. For example, one sentence reads, ""Initial reports confirmed that the US-VISIT workstations were (redacted) impacted"" by the virus. The blacked-out portion might as easily read ""severely"" as ""not.""

Other redactions appear less tactical: A public Microsoft security bulletin is included, but with the bulletin number (MS05-039) blacked out.

Perhaps most significantly, the pages do not reveal how the Zotob virus made its way onto the private CBP network -- an ominous migration that demonstrates that computers used in protecting U.S. borders are accessible, via some path, from the public internet, and could be subject to tampering.

""That machine was reachable from some network, that was connected to some other network, that was connected to the internet,"" says Tim Mullen, a Windows security expert and CIO of security firm AnchorIS. ""There was some series of connections that manifested itself in those machines getting compromised.""

A September report by the DHS inspector general found computer security at CBP wanting. In a scan of 368 devices on CBP networks, investigators identified 906 security vulnerabilities rated as medium or high risk. They criticized CBP for failing to implement a comprehensive security testing program, among other issues.

""Our vulnerability assessments identified security concerns resulting from inadequate password controls, missing critical patches, vulnerable network devices and weaknesses in configuration management,"" the report concludes. ""These security concerns provide increased potential for unauthorized access to CBP resources and data.""

In a second report in December focused on US-VISIT, the inspector general concluded that the mainframe databases at the backend of the system were generally secure. But investigators found vulnerabilities elsewhere in the system's architecture that ""could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive US-VISIT data.""

In particular, the report found system vulnerabilities at the U.S. points of entry where the US-VISIT workstations are operating. It blames the weaknesses on poor communications between administrators in the field and those at US-VISIT's Virginia data center. In February, the Government Accountability Office -- Congress' investigative arm -- followed up with its own investigation of the program, faulting US-VISIT for not having an overall security plan.

Besides management issues, the system has been criticized as a slapdash effort at stringing older technology together into a modern security screening system. ""Biometrics have been introduced into an antiquated computer environment,"" the 9/11 Commission noted of the program. ""Replacement of these systems and improved biometric systems will be required.""

Schmidt agrees, though he says the problem is hardly limited to US-VISIT. ""We have to start moving at industry speed, not government speed, when it comes to the deployment of new technologies,"" says Schmidt. Instead of running Windows 2000, ""I'd be racing to run the beta of the next generation of operating system ... and not worry about legacy stuff that we know isn't going to be supported too much longer and has had issues.""","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Customs,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,airport/port/customs/systems"

The Flight Data Processing System failed for 20 minutes earlier this week, causing delays and cancellations.

Technology workers at the U.K.'s National Air Traffic Services are still trying to determine what caused the organization's main Flight Data Processing System to fail this week and they cannot rule out a recurrence of the event, a NATS spokesman said Thursday.

The system went down for 20 minutes Wednesday morning, causing numerous delays and flight cancellations at London's beleaguered Heathrow airport. Air-traffic controllers use the processing system to route aircraft through Britain's heavily trafficked skies. The system uses custom software running on an IBM S/390 server. The spokesman says NATS IT workers haven't yet determined whether a hardware or software problem was to blame for the failure. The system also experienced a major outage in 2000 and a more minor failure in June of last year.

NATS, along with other European air-traffic authorities, is in the early stages of planning for a $1.8 billion upgrade to its computerized air-traffic-control systems. The spokesman says specifications for the new system haven't yet been published. NATS insists that Wednesday's outage didn't compromise air safety.

Heathrow was hit hard earlier this month when workers at the company that provides catering services for British Airways staged a wildcat strike. BA and Gate Gourmet are in negotiations aimed at preventing a recurrence. The strike forced BA to temporarily cancel all of its flights in and out of Heathrow.

""There is a clear and present crisis,"" Mr Morris said. Freight cannot be cleared by stevedores or put through quarantine and security because faulty data is being returned by the system.

Containers are backing up at freight terminals all over Australia, operators are facing huge penalties for storage and for failure to deliver goods on time. In some cases, freight forwarders attempting to use the new system are being sent data relating to other companies, involving issues of privacy and security, he said.

Transport operators are also being hit and are reassigning trucks rather than lose money by having them wait for freight that does not clear.

""The situation will get worse before it gets better,"" said Neil Chambers, deputy chief executive of the Victorian Transport Association. ""Transport operators, their container supply chain partners and their clients need to brace themselves.

""Even if a decision is made this afternoon to revert to legacy systems, there will be significant delays in the delivery of cargo and additional costs will be incurred,"" he said.

Hundreds of vehicle booking slots were being dumped back into transport company booking systems as operators made futile trips to wharves and some attracted no-show penalties from stevedores, Mr Chambers said. Now, even if all containers in the log jam could be cleared overnight, there would be no trucks to move them and storage charges would mount.

An emergency meeting was held in Sydney last night between Customs Minister Chris Ellison and industry representatives, including executives of stevedoring organisations Patricks and P&O, to discuss what Mr Morris yesterday described as ""the most serious crisis to hit this industry since our council was formed in 1904"".

The Customs Service issued a statement saying that more than 200 staff had been deployed to ensure that ""a 24-hour help desk service is available to customs brokers, freight forwarders and other key industry sectors needing help with the new system"".

Consideration was being given to reverting to the old IT system until the new one had been proven, the statement said.

Sources in the freight industry say that, for a time, Customs had waived quarantine and security requirements in an effort to reduce the backlog, but protests from organisations within and outside government had led to their reimposition. Teams of Customs officers were manually clearing freight at some airports and seaports to help with the logjam, the Customs spokesman said.

According to Mr Morris, the new and needed update of the Customs computer system was originally costed at $33 million. The cost had blown out to more than $250 million, and the system still did not work, he said.

Mr Morris said his council had been expressing its concerns for more than a year over what he called the failure of Customs to consult properly with the industry as the new system was being built.

He said the new system was first envisaged about 10 years ago. ""It was supposed to take us into the new millennium. It is three years late in roll-out. The most critical part was Release 5, which relates to the whole of the import processing. It went live on October 12.

""We said in September we were scared witless it wouldn't work,"" he said. ""We were told we were doomsayers. We have been told that as late as October 11 the system was not in a position to be cut over, but they did it anyway.""","Australia,Operational Failure,Government,National,Customs,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,Impact - Currency,airport/port/customs/systems"

its demise. And despite Accenture delivering ""considerable improvements"" and cost reductions, ultimately they were proved right.

The plan was the brainchild of Peter Davis, who had taken over as chief executive six months earlier, determined to regain the company's position as the UK's leading supermarket. The deal aimed to save Sainsbury's a total of £245m over the seven-year life of the contact.

Davis made it no secret that he believed the company's ageing IT systems were partly to blame for its failure to keep pace with rival retailers. ""The age and complexity of our current IT systems are hampering our ability to perform and develop. We spend in excess of £200m a year on our IT, it is essential that we get better value for money,"" he said at the time of the deal.

Davis had already signed a huge outsourcing contract with Accenture in July 1997, in his role as head of insurance firm Prudential, and felt he could replicate the benefits of that contract at Sainsbury's.

Accenture took over responsibility for designing, building, implementing and running all the retailer's IT systems and networks. It also took over the management of 700 IT staff from Sainsbury's offices in Blackfriars.

Sainsbury's top priority was to replace its outdated Cobol-based systems with packaged software that would enable it to run more complex integrated systems.

Davis' assumption was that Accenture would help the retailer improve its balance sheet, and at the same time inject a heavy dose of project management skills to implement the IT upgrades Sainsbury's desperately needed.

""He was right on both counts,"" said outsourcing consultant Richard Sykes. ""But that was not what Sainsbury's needed. It needed a strategic partner with a deep understanding of the retail process.""

In December 2003, Sainsbury's extended the Accenture deal from seven years to 10 years, pushing up the value of the contract from £1.7bn to £2.1bn. But four years into the contract Davis was ousted, and his successor, Justin King, began an operational review of the IT contract.

Sainsbury's announced plans to write off more than £100m in IT investments, following problems with delivery systems that fell outside the Accenture contract.

The supermarket also began discussions with Accenture in an attempt to gain more control over its IT systems.

In December 2004, Maggie Miller, Sainsbury's chief information officer, stepped down in favour of Angela Morrison. Morrison had made her name as the IT director of Asda, where she ended an IT outsourcing deal with IBM and took IT systems back in-house.

By this time, Accenture had completed the major IT investments and change programmes it was contracted to deliver. There was not much more to do other than ""squeezing costs down"", Miller told Computer Weekly.

Morrison formally took over in March this year. By April, speculation about the future of the Accenture deal was mounting, as Sainsbury's began bringing IT staff back into its London headquarters.

Last week Sainsbury's ended its relationship with Accenture, five years before the contract was officially due to end. It said, ""Accenture has delivered considerable improvements in operation cost reductions and system stability."" The supplier had also almost completed replatforming Sainsbury's IT systems.","UK,Project Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,£,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Contract termination/cancellation"

The exchange was only able to operate for 90 minutes on 1 November due to bugs with a newly installed transactions system, developed by Fujitsu, which was supposed to help cope with higher trading volumes. The interruption in trading was the worst in the history of the exchange.

""Flawed instructions we received from Fujitsu regarding system improvements to its software seem to have caused the glitch,"" TSE spokesman Mitsuo Miwa told Reuters. The news agency reports that the exchange is yet to decide whether or not to sue Fujitsu over the outage. Nagoya Stock Exchange experienced a similar trading halt three days after the TSE glitch, which have also been traced back to Fujitsu software.

In a show of humility over the cock-up, Fujitsu's board has agreed to slash president Hiroaki Kurokawa's salary in half for six months, and levied pay-cuts of between 10 to 25 per cent on other senior executives including those running its financial systems division. Tokyo Stock Exchange has already imposed a similar set of pay cuts on its executives right down to slashing the monthly pay of President Takuo Tsurushima by half for six months. It's unclear if Fujitsu will plough the cost savings from its salary cuts into its own business or hand over the dosh to Tokyo Stock Exchange. ®

Last month, a computer glitch shut down trading on the exchange, the world's second-largest after the New York Stock Exchange, for almost an entire day. Then last week, a typographical error by the Mizuho Securities brokerage generated a $330 million loss. On Friday, the prime minister demanded corrective steps, and regulators began an investigation.

""I can't imagine problems like these happening at the New York Stock Exchange,"" said Neil Katkov, an analyst in Tokyo for Celent, a research firm based in Boston that specializes in financial technology. The Tokyo Stock Exchange, he said, ""hasn't brought its procedures and technology up to the norms of international exchanges.""

The latest electronic mix-up began last Thursday during the initial public offering of J-Com, a small recruiting company. An employee at Mizuho, a subsidiary of the Mizuho Financial Group, mistakenly typed an order to sell 610,000 shares at 1 yen, or less than a penny each, instead of an order to sell one share at 610,000 yen ($5,057) as intended, the brokerage said.

At that price, the sale would have been worth $3.1 billion, far more than the company's actual value. But the number of shares ostensibly being sold far exceeded the shares on offer.

Mizuho's computer failed to catch the error, but that wasn't all. As Mizuho tried frantically to cancel the order, the computer at the Tokyo Stock Exchange blocked its efforts for about 10 minutes, the exchange said. Mizuho finally managed to buy back most of the mistaken order before investors did.

But investors did buy about 100,000 of the nonexistent shares. Mizuho said Thursday that the typo would cost it 27 billion yen, or about $230 million, to reimburse buyers and cancel the order. But on Monday the stock exchange raised the total loss to 40 billion yen, or $330 million, ordering Mizuho to pay investors a premium of 300,000 yen, for a total payment of 910,000 yen for each share sold. The higher sum reflected an advisory group's calculation of where J-Com shares would have traded had the market not been flooded with the mistaken sell order.

But the exchange also said it would share the cost of the debacle with Mizuho. It was not clear, however, how much of the loss the exchange would assume.

In a hastily called news conference late Sunday evening, the exchange's president and chief executive, Takuo Tsurushima, admitted that a failure by the exchange's computer system was also at fault. Previously, the exchange had squarely blamed Mizuho, saying that the brokerage had not only botched the trade order but also had made an error as it tried to stop the order.

But Mr. Tsurushima also made reference to a glitch on Nov. 1 that froze trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for all but 90 minutes of an entire day, an unusual and embarrassing mishap for one of the world's top bourses.

""I feel a heavy responsibility for having caused turmoil in the market twice in such a short time,"" Mr. Tsurushima told reporters. He said he might resign, a customary gesture in Japan to take responsibility.

The investors will get cash instead of J-Com stock, the exchange said. Cash settlements have been used in the past to compensate investors when natural disasters disrupted trading, but are rare otherwise.

On Monday, Japan's Financial Services Agency ordered the Tokyo Stock Exchange to report on the cause of Thursday's failures. Japanese media reports said the agency may also order the exchange to completely revamp its computer system.

That computer system was designed by Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics company. Last month, Fujitsu said it cut the pay of its top executives as punishment for the company's role in the November failure.

Even Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi commented on the problem. ""We need to think more about putting safety measures in place to prevent confusion,"" he said Friday, according to the Associated Press.

The twin mishaps have raised concerns about the reliability of the Tokyo Stock Exchange's computer system at a time when a rebound in Japan's economy is bringing record trading volumes. Critics have castigated the exchange for failing to invest in modern computer systems or upgrade the system it has.

And some traders say the incidents point to a deeper underlying problem. They fault a bureaucratic culture of secrecy at the exchange that makes it reluctant to reveal details of its trading systems, even to brokerages. Some foreign trading firms have complained that the exchange does not respond to even routine inquiries about its systems.

Experts say other exchanges are far more transparent and rely on give-and-take with members to detect possible problems in the complex computer systems. They say the New York Stock Exchange routinely tests its computer system with big brokerages to avoid mishaps.

But Mr. Katkov, the Celent analyst, noted that Thursday's failure highlighted another problem: the inadequate computer systems used by Japanese financial companies. ""An advanced electronic trading system should never have let this trade out of the gate,"" he said.","Japan,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,stock exchanges"
2005-12-01T07:00:00Z,US DHS Cancels eMerge2 Program, $18.3 Million ,,,,,,,1.83E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,http://fcw.com/articles/2006/03/30/emerge2s-failure-sends-dhs-back-to-drawing-board.aspx?admgarea=TC_Management,,EMERGE2's failure sends DHS back to drawing board -- FCW,"EMERGE2's failure sends DHS back to drawing board

The Homeland Security Department’s acting chief financial officer said it’s back to the drawing board after the failure of a high-profile project intended to establish a single enterprise financial and asset management system for the 22 agencies that make up DHS.

DHS officials awarded a blanket purchase agreement – potentially worth up to $229 million – to BearingPoint in fall 2004 for the Electronically Managing Enterprise Resources for Government Efficiency and Effectiveness (EMERGE2) initiative. But last year they scuttled the project after officials found it wasn’t going in the right direction and was too risky to continue.

Eugene Schied, the acting CFO, said the department had spent $18.3 million before it found the project was unworkable. He said DHS officials have abandoned the notion to rebid the contract.

“I don’t see there’s going to be another,” he told congressional lawmakers at a hearing yesterday afternoon.

Instead, DHS officials will now go through a replanning phase that will look at several viable alternatives, including initiatives several DHS agencies have undertaken. For example, Customs and Border Protection had been implementing an integrated suite of SAP resource management systems, and the Coast Guard and Secret Service were upgrading their systems during the EMERGE2 project.

Schied said the Coast Guard also became a service provider to the Transportation Security Administration in 2005 because TSA officials were unhappy with the Transportation Department’s system. He said the new arrangement seems to work well.

DHS officials hope to present a plan to the department’s Investment Review Board, which must analyze major information technology initiatives, in May or June, Schied said. He estimated the new system would cost $150 million to $200 million because it would contain similar elements to EMERGE2, such as costs associated with cleaning up data and implementing a data warehouse.

Scott Charbo, DHS’ chief information officer, said EMERGE2 wasn’t a total waste. He said the requirements developed for the project could be used in any future development.

DHS officials appeared at a joint hearing of the House Government Reform Committee’s Government Management, Finance and Accountability Subcommittee and the House Homeland Security Committee’s Management, Integration and Oversight Subcommittee.

Several lawmakers were dismayed about the millions of dollars spent on the failed project.

“I am just shocked about the repetitiveness that just keeps coming up about expenditures,” said Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). “I know this is just one particular area.”

Representatives were also concerned about departures of several DHS executives, which could have led to general problems and the issues with EMERGE2.","US,Project Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

The outage began around 8:30 a.m. Pacific Time and ended around noon, according to a spokeswoman for Microsoft. The company is still trying to determine what caused the problem.

The search engine, reached at http://www.msn.com and at http://search.msn.com, appeared to be working properly at press time.

MSN's search engine fields about 2.5 billion queries from users worldwide every month, the spokeswoman said. It ranked third in the U.S. in February with 13.5 percent of all queries, behind leader Google (42.3 percent) and Yahoo (27.6 percent), according to comScore Networks.

It's not common for an outage of this length and severity to affect a service of such high visibility from a vendor with deep technical resources and expertise.

It also doesn't help Microsoft's years-long crusade to give Google a run for its money in the search engine market. Microsoft has invested heavily in recent years to develop its own search engine technology and accompanying paid search ad network.

In March, Microsoft begin testing an enhanced version of its search engine, featuring a new image search service, a redesigned user interface and new tools to refine query results. The enhanced search engine, called Windows Live Search, is at http://www.live.com, and it wasn't affected by Thursday's outage, the spokeswoman said.

As part of Windows Live Search's announcement last month, Justin Osmer, an MSN senior product manager, told IDG News Service that Microsoft believes these are still early days in the search engine market and that victory can't be conceded to Google. ""We see this as a long-term problem to solve. A lot can be done in search to make it a better experience,"" he said.","Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,IT,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,Microsoft"
2006-05-01T07:00:00Z,Software bug takes down Amtrak Power in Northeast, About a 4 hour outage ,,,4,hours,4,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Rail,http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/24/us/24amtrak.html,,New Parts in Old System Are Cited in Amtrak Trouble,"WASHINGTON, Feb. 23  The power supply system for trains running between New York and Washington, a concatenation of parts whose oldest links date back 80 years, failed last May 25 because of a hidden flaw in some of the newest equipment in the chain, the railroad said Friday.

A 4-year-old computer in Philadelphia failed to execute a single command given 36 hours earlier, after maintenance had been done on the evening of May 23, and then failed to alert human controllers that it had not followed instructions, according to an extensive investigation performed by outside experts. The effect was to limit the amount of power available in the system, leaving no margin during periods of peak demand.

The system muddled through the morning and evening rush hours on May 24, but on the morning of the 25th it became overloaded and failed, according to Amtrak. Giant machines, needed to convert power to the type Amtrak needs, failed one by one, first at a substation in Sunnyside, Queens; then at Jericho Park, near Bowie, Md.; and then Lamokin, near the Pennsylvania-Delaware border.

Once the Sunnyside equipment shut itself down to prevent overload, you had this cascading effect, said William Crosbie, the railroads vice president for operations. Once you had the snowball rolling down the hill, it was inevitable.

But the fact that a 4-year-old component caused the failure of equipment built in the 1920s was incongruous enough that Mr. Crosbie referred to it, ruefully, as a punch line.

The power failure struck during the morning rush hour, stranding 112 trains with tens of thousands of passengers on board. Many were stuck for hours in tunnels under the Hudson River.

Adding to the problem was that much of the equipment is remotely controlled, but if the power fails, a technician must be present to restart it, by physically resetting electrical breakers. At a key location, Sunnyside Yard in Queens, Amtrak had to send a technician through rush-hour traffic before it could start restorations.

Another problem was the magnitude of the blackout. Some equipment, the investigators noted, cannot be restarted without having electricity available.

As part of the changes instituted since the blackout, Amtrak now keeps a technician on site during rush hours at Sunnyside and other key sites, where it imports power from the commercial utility grid. The grid supplies alternating current at 60 cycles, which is in near-universal use in North America. But between New York and Washington, Amtrak trains and the commuter trains that use its rails run on an older standard, 25 cycles.

Amtrak also stations a rescue locomotive at the New Jersey side of the Hudson River tunnels and has instituted procedures to bring additional diesels from Sunnyside through the East River tunnels and Penn Station and into the Hudson River tunnels if needed.

Mr. Crosbie said Amtrak and NJ Transit are cross-training their crews. In May, one problem was that the crew of the Amtrak locomotive that reached an NJ Transit train stuck in a tunnel did not know how to release its brakes.

Another layer of irony is that the procedure for reducing power during maintenance was probably unnecessary to begin with, he said. When Amtrak inquired about the purpose of the procedure, the vendor didnt have a good explanation for that, he said. Mr. Crosbie said he would not identify the company that had sold Amtrak the equipment.

Two companies that took credit for building the Philadelphia substation, called Richmond, declined to comment Friday. They are Advanced Control Systems of Norcross, Ga., and Siemens Transportation of Sacramento, Calif.

After the blackout, the equipment manufacturer decided that instead of fixing the system to assure that the command to restore full power was accomplished or the human operator notified, the whole procedure should be eliminated, he said.

Mr. Crosbie said Amtrak was not pursuing any damage claims over the failure.

The computer that failed was one of a pair, installed with the idea of providing redundancy. But the second computer had communications problems and was out of service at the time of the failure, he said.

The railroad, its utility suppliers and other companies involved agreed to have the investigation conducted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, which produced the report on the Northeast blackout of 2003.

Amtrak has invested heavily in its electric system in recent years, and after the failure in May, attention was focused  wrongly, as it turns out  on the components from the 1920s and 1930s. Lamokin, for example, dates from 1928. And the failure would have been much less likely on older equipment, Mr. Crosbie said.

In the old days, you had switches and gauges, he said, and a glance would reveal that one of them was out of position.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Rail,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit"

Computer Outage Strikes Montana State Government

Much of Montana's government computer system crashed Monday, idling state employees and frustrating those who wanted to do such things as renew driver's licenses and obtain fishing permits.

Technicians were unable to locate the problem by late afternoon, making no promises when the computers would be working again.

Some key systems used by the Montana Highway Patrol and others were rerouted, the governor's office said. Arrangements had been made so that debit cards used by those who receive food stamps would also work.

But the vast majority of services and computers remained down, and state government was essentially immobilized, said Dick Clark, the state's chief information officer.

Clark said he couldn't speculate if a virus or hacker was to blame. Workers monitoring the state network saw a ""spike"" in traffic around 1:30 a.m. Monday, and noticed performance problems. The network then shut down.

Clark said state government saw similar problems about four years ago when a virus brought the network down.

FinCEN Halts BSA Direct Retrieval and Sharing Project

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today announced it will permanently halt the current BSA Direct Retrieval and Sharing Component (BSA Direct R&S) project. The project has repeatedly missed program milestones and performance objectives and the current performance of the system does not meet the needs of FinCEN's users. The level of effort and costs to complete BSA Direct R&S, address all remaining defects of the system, and operate and maintain the system, are likely to be much greater than originally projected. Going forward, FinCEN will inventory its capacity, assess its needs and the needs of its customers, and begin planning for future capabilities for retrieval, sharing and enhanced analysis of the Bank Secrecy Act data.

""I am disappointed that this part of the BSA Direct project, which was an ambitious one, could not be completely salvaged,"" said Robert W. Werner, Director of the FinCEN. ""However, in good conscience, I could not devote further resources to the project when I can find no guarantee that any amount of added spending would ever produce the desired result. This decision is in the best interest of the government, of the taxpayers, and of our law enforcement customers.""

Currently BSA Direct R&S is a partially-built system that integrates a number of best-in-class products that, at this point, do not function well together. Neither FinCEN nor its three external, expert consultants can definitively predict how close the system is to meeting its requirements or the time, resources, and risks involved in completing the system. As a result, FinCEN has decided that the best course of action is to terminate this contract for the convenience of the Government. FinCEN reached this conclusion in consultation with outside technology experts.

In March, Director Werner notified Congress that he was issuing a 90-day ""stop-work"" order to Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the contractor hired to build the system, because of his concerns that the project had failed repeatedly to meet its program milestones and performance objectives. An assessment was then undertaken to evaluate the future viability of this system. In May the stop-work period was extended an additional 30 days.

The original cost estimate of $8.9 million for the contract increased to $15.1 million. Of that amount, $14.4 million has been spent. Also, the scheduled delivery date slipped from October 2005. At least $8 million would likely be needed before the system could be completed and an additional $2.5 million per year more for Operations and Maintenance. As the attached report indicates, even this additional investment would not ensure a reliable schedule or a usable product.

FinCEN launched BSA Direct R&S, a data warehouse and information retrieval system, in July 2004 as a component of BSA Direct, an umbrella project with several components including retrieval and sharing, electronic filing, and secure access. The electronic filing and secure access components have been operational for a number of years. The development of BSA Direct R&S was aimed to improve authorized users' ability to analyze and access Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) data. It was intended to apply data warehousing technology to structure the data in a single, integrated, secure web-based environment, and provide more sophisticated business intelligence and other analytical tools in a user-friendly web portal.

FinCEN's law enforcement customers are not significantly impacted by the decision to halt BSA Direct R&S. They can continue to use FinCEN's Secure Outreach system to access BSA data, and soon will transition to the IRS' Web CBRS for retrieval and online analysis of BSA information.

Citing breach of contract, the North Carolina Health and Human Services Department has terminated Affiliated Computer Services Inc.'s contract to deliver a new Medicaid payment system for the Tar Heel State.ACS of Dallas failed to meet staffing levels and did not complete terms of its contract, which called for the company to build and operate a new Medicaid Management Information System, Secretary Carmen Hooker Odom wrote in a July 14 letter notifying ACS of the contract termination.The five-year contract, which began in April 2004, was valued at $171 million.North Carolina's award to ACS was troubled from the outset. Following the selection of ACS in 2004, both EDS Corp., and Unisys Corp., protested it.The rancor between ACS and EDS continued through 2005, with EDS lawyers writing Democratic Gov.

The news comes just two months after ministers announced that the DWP’s crisis-ridden Child Support Agency would be closed down, following the collapse of its £456m IT system.

The Benefits Processing Replacement Programme was originally designed to bring together and streamline the processing of a range of different benefits.

But it is understood that there were questions over how this would be done, before the announcement of a new Employment Support Allowance in January led to a change of priorities.

The programme had been expected to save £60m, but cost £141m in the three years since it was begun, the BBC’s Today programme revealed. The system was axed in February without ever being put into use.

A spokesman for the DWP said, “In line with best practice and in the light of concerns about the progress of this programme, BPRP was recently reviewed.

“As a result, the programme has been refocused to concentrate on the delivery of the new Employment Support Allowance announced in January of this year.”

He added, “The previous programme has now been formally closed, although a number of individual projects within it are being taken forward.”

2006-10-01T07:00:00Z,Airbus Blames Design Software Incompatibility for Airbus A380 Two Year Delay,€4.8 billion in lost earnings up to 2010,,,,,,,4.8E9,€,EUR,Europe,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2006-10-04/airbus-first-blame-the-software; http://www.spiegel.de/international/airbus-debacle-worsens-new-a380-delays-to-cost-billions-a-440642.html,,"Airbus: First, Blame the Software || Airbus Debacle Worsens: New A380 Delays To Cost Billions","Global Economics

It sounds too simple to be true. Airbus' A380 megajet is now a full two years behind schedule—and the reason, CEO Christian Streiff admitted on Oct. 3, is that design software used at different Airbus factories wasn't compatible.

Early this year, when pre-assembled bundles containing hundreds of miles of cabin wiring were delivered from a German factory to the assembly line in France, workers discovered that the bundles, called harnesses, didn't fit properly into the plane. Assembly slowed to a near-standstill, as workers tried to pull the bundles apart and re-thread them through the fuselage. Now Airbus will have to go back to the drawing board and redesign the wiring system.

It's shaping up to be one of the costliest blunders in the history of commercial aerospace. Airbus' parent, European Aeronautic Defence & Space, expects to take a $6.1 billion profit hit over the next four years. Airlines that have ordered the A380 are fuming, and though none so far has canceled an order, Airbus will have to pay millions in late-delivery penalties.

INTEGRATION DISINTEGRATION. How could the global No. 1 aircraft maker have messed up so badly? The answer lies in another major Airbus undertaking that was largely overshadowed by the launch of the world's biggest passenger jet. At the end of 2000, just as Airbus gave the go-ahead to the A380, the company announced it was completing the process of transforming itself into an integrated corporation.

Since its founding in 1970, Airbus had operated as a loose consortium of aerospace companies in France, Germany, Britain, and Spain. Now, the company said, these operations would be knit together into a smooth-running, pan-European business.

In fact, Airbus remained surprisingly balkanized—and the tangled mess inside the A380 is the disastrous result. ""The various Airbus locations had their own legacy software, methods, procedures, and Airbus never succeeded in unifying all those efforts,"" says Hans Weber, CEO of San Diego-based aviation consultant Tecop International, who has close contacts with the company's German operations.

ONE-WAY STREET. Experts familiar with Airbus' design operations tell BusinessWeek.com that the Toulouse assembly plant used the latest version of a sophisticated design software tool called CATIA, made by France's Dassault Systèmes (DASTY), an independent software spinout of French airplane maker Dassault Aviation. But the design center at the Hamburg factory used an earlier version of the CATIA software dating from the 1980s.

As a result, design specs could not flow easily back and forth between the two systems. ""The two systems are completely different, they have nothing to do with each other,"" says Robert Weigl, the Munich-based director of professional services for Proficiency, a Waltham, Mass.-based company that specializes in helping manufacturers integrate different design software.

Why wouldn't Airbus factories all clamor to switch to the latest software? Some local managers apparently balked because of the time and expense involved in retraining engineers to use new design tools. Still, Airbus' top management could have insisted on the changeover…but it didn't.

THEN THERE WERE THREE. One reason may be that Airbus' top management was cobbled together from leaders of the former consortium members. They retained close ties with managers in their own countries and may have been reluctant to force unwanted changes on them. Whatever the reason, Weber says, ""It is a massive management failure. There are tremendously dedicated and intelligent people throughout Airbus, and some of them wanted to get [the newest] CATIA embedded, but management just didn't put a high priority on it.""

Besides using two versions of Dassault's CATIA on the A380, Airbus also designed much of the plane using software made by a different supplier, Parametric Technology (PMTC) of Needham, Mass. (Parametric says its software is not used for the plane's electrical harnesses, however.)

Indeed, while Dassault Systèmes has been widely regarded for more than a decade as the global leader in aircraft design software, Airbus didn't start buying its software until 2000. Airbus resisted moving to Dassault, some insiders say, out of rivalry with Dassault Aviation, a French maker of fighter planes and executive jets that spun off from the Dassault Systèmes software business.

2D MODELING. Airbus also might have avoided the wiring debacle if its engineers had been using a full digital mockup of the A380, a three-dimensional computer-generated model incorporating all the plane's specifications and subsequent modifications. Rival Boeing (BA) is using such a system for its new 787 Dreamliner. Even Dassault Aviation's latest corporate jet is built from a digital mockup.

Yet Airbus, the global No. 1, only signed its first major contracts for digital-mockup software from Dassault Systèmes within the past year, according to people knowledgeable with the deal.

Can Streiff, Airbus' new CEO, repair the damage? Almost certainly, but it will take time. As with design software, the switch to a digital mockup can't be accomplished overnight. In announcing the latest A380 delays, Airbus said, ""The root cause of the problem is that the 3D digital mockup, which facilitates the design of the electrical harnesses' installation, was implemented late and that the people working on it were in their learning curve.""

WE HAVE SEEN THE ENEMY. An even tougher challenge for Streiff will be to persuade Airbus' disunited operations to yield to centralized management. Indeed, the infighting could get much worse. German politicians flew into a tizzy after Streiff announced plans to seek more than $6 billion in cost cuts over the next five years.

They're worried that the new Airbus CEO, who is French, will try to save money by slashing jobs in Germany. For more than three decades, Boeing has loomed as Airbus' biggest rival. But now, the biggest threat to Airbus may lie in its own organization.








REUTERS Parent company EADS announced further delays to the delivery of the Airbus 380

Airbus' parent company EADS, European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., on Tuesday announced further delays to its A380 superjumbo, sending its share price plummeting and sparking fears that airlines may cancel orders.

Shares in EADS fell as much as 11.7% on Wednesday after the company said it did not expect to deliver its first Airbus A380 superjumbo until the second half of 2007. It is the third delay the company has announced within the last six months.

With the fresh delay of a year, the world's largest passenger jet is now two years behind schedule. Airbus CEO Christian Steiff said the delay was caused by problems with the installation of wiringon the planes.

EADS is predicting a profit shortfall of 2.8 billion over four years on top of 2 billion euros disclosed in June and is embarking on sweeping reforms of its industrial processes in 16 plants in France, Germany, Britain and Spain. The restructuring is aimed at saving at least 2 billion a year in costs from 2010, while increasing productivity by 20 percent.

In 2007 the company expects to deliver just one aircraft, instead of the nine it had promised originally. The first company to take delivery will be Singapore Airlines, and it has now been told to expect its first A380 in October next year instead of December 2006. The inaugural flight is due to take off from London, and the company had even run a competition for seats on the flight. The airline has described the delays as ""disappointing.""

Airbus has sold 159 of the $250 million jets to 16 airlines and it now aims to deliver 13 of the planes in 2008, 25 the following year, and 45 in 2010. The biggest customers, Emirates and Lufthansa, confirmed Tuesday that they were expecting delays of between 10 months and a year. Lufthansa now expects to see its first A380 aircraft delivered in the summer of 2009.

According to Airbus, there is no sign of any of its customers canceling their orders. CEO Christian Streiff told the BBC, ""Everybody is still on board."" However, Qantas, which will now receive its first A380 in August 2008 -- two years late -- was more equivocal. Executive General Manager John Borghetti told Reuters: ""I'm not going to speculate on that. That's just between us and Airbus."" Meanwhile Emirates said it was examining all options.

The European aviation company is expected to have to pay out sizeable penalties to its disappointed customers. While this is expected to actually make the aircraft a more attractive purchase than ever, the constant delays amount to a PR disaster for the company and could well deter prospective customers.

""This could be the tipping point -- not necessarily for those customers that have already ordered the A380, but for those who are about to order some large aircraft,"" J.B. Groh, an analyst with investment bank D.A. Davidson & Co., told Associated Press.

Another knock-on effect of this latest A380 debacle is that the production of the company's smaller A350 aircraft is now certain to be delayed, as Airbus scrambles to get the supersize jet to its customers. The A350 model will now probably only appear in 2012, instead of 2010 as originally announced. That's a good four years behind competitor Boeing's new long-range, fuel-efficient passenger liner, the 787 Dreamliner. The US company already has 380 orders for the aircraft.

There are concerns in Germany that the delays and restructuring program will lead to job losses at the Airbus plant in Hamburg, amid fears that the entire production of the aircraft could be moved to Toulouse. German Economy Minister Michael Glos is to hold crisis talks with Airbus CEO Christian Steiff in Berlin on Thursday.

Airbus' German works council and the IG Metall trade union issued a statement criticising the management. ""Planning and guidelines for the launch of the A380 were totally unrealistic, they said in a joint statement, adding that serious errors of judgment by the management were the main cause of the current crisis. The trade union also warned that it would protest against any threatened job cuts.

According to Spiegel sources, the German government is now considering investing in EADS if the major German shareholder DaimlerChrysler sells further shares in Airbus' parent company.

The state-owned German development bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) might temporarily take over EADS shares to ensure that they stay in German hands and act as a counter-balance to the French shareholders in EADS.

2007-02-01T07:00:00Z,Wisconsin Pulls Plug on $41.2 Million  EnAbles  Unemployment Insurance Project, $23.6 Million spent on system which was supposed to be built over 7 phases; phase 1 worked and cost $13 Million; phase 2 never worked and cost $10 Million ,,,,,,,2.36E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Labor,,http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/29386584.html,,State scraps computer project,"When the project to track unemployment insurance claims was planned, the Department of Workforce Development expected a cost ofbut by last year the department estimated it would cost

The state has pulled the plug on what was to be a $41.2 million computer project after it spent $10 million on a key component that has yet to work.

The suspension of the federally funded EnABLES project comes in the midst of an audit of state information technology projects and less than a year after the University of Wisconsin System abandoned a payroll system that had cost $26 million.

The state has been beset with a host of computer problems in recent years, including a failed e-mail upgrade, a long-delayed voter registration system and a database that has not accurately tracked sales tax collections. Together, the value of those troubled projects exceeds $100 million.

""We need to get our arms around these incredible, egregious wastes of money,"" state Sen. Robert Cowles (R-Green Bay) said.

Cowles helped secure a legislative audit last year that could be finished as early as next month. It will include a detailed analysis of several projects, including the Enhanced Automated Benefits Legal Enterprise Services, or EnABLES.

The Department of Workforce Development project was designed to replace a 1970s system used to track the 600,000 unemployment insurance claims and appeals made each year. But the department decided to halt the project Feb. 9 because of rising costs and countless delays, said Hal Bergan, the state's unemployment insurance administrator.

""The overall problem we were having is we were making progress, but we were making progress at such a pace that it was not sustainable,"" Bergan said. ""It took too long and it cost too much.""

The state has spent $23.6 million on the system so far. The project was to be built in seven phases, but only the first phase was successfully finished. That component created a paperless claims process that cost about $13 million, Bergan said.

About $10 million was spent on the second phase, an appeals system that was never finished.

Of the $23.6 million spent on the project, $10.4 million went to prime contractor Tier Technologies, $2.6 million went to Curam Software and the rest was used to pay state employees and buy equipment.

The department will now spend about six months determining how to proceed. Bergan said the state would likely use a different computer platform for the appeals process, but whatever it uses will be integrated with the claims system.

""In effect, we're reconsidering decisions made six years ago"" about how to build the system, Bergan said.

When the department planned the job, it expected it to cost $24 million, but by last year the department estimated it would cost $41.2 million through 2010. Ending the project now prevents costs from climbing that high.

A 2005 review found that top Tier employees were paid more than any other state IT contractors. At one stage, the state paid $314 an hour for the services of one high-level Tier employee. A revised contract last year reduced the hourly rates.

Tier spokesman Matt Brusch did not return a call.

IT audit ordered

Last spring, lawmakers ordered the Legislative Audit Bureau to do a detailed review of several IT projects and survey the state's overall handling of computer systems. Shortly thereafter, the UW System abandoned its failed payroll system after spending $26 million in taxpayer and tuition money on it.

EnABLES is one of the projects getting the most scrutiny from auditors. Bergan said deciding to end the project was not related to the audit.

Gov. Jim Doyle cited the need to cut computer contracts in the budget speech he delivered Tuesday. From 2003 to 2004, Doyle's first year in office, state spending on IT contracts dropped 24%, according to an administration report.

Work on EnABLES started in 2001, before Doyle was elected; Tier was hired after Doyle took office. The state put the project out for bid again in 2005 in hopes of lowering costs, but Tier was the only qualified bidder to respond.

A related project has also been plagued with delays. The Statewide Unemployment Insurance Tax Enterprise System, or SUITES, was originally budgeted at $17.2 million, but is now expected to cost $29 million - $12.2 million more than originally planned.

That system tracks unemployment insurance taxes paid quarterly by 130,000 businesses. The department anticipates finishing the project by the end of the year, 3 1/2 years behind schedule.

Accenture, the prime contractor for the job, completed its share of work in 2005, and state employees are now completing the project. Accenture was paid $14.1 million for its work, about $2 million more than in the original contract. Accenture has said the delays were caused by the state because it changed the scope of the project.

Accenture is now helping build the state's troubled voter database. Legislators have raised concerns about that work because it was supposed to be completed more than a year ago under federal law.

The project is not slated to be done until late this year or early 2008. Accenture contends that most of the remaining work is the state's responsibility.","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Labor,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

Facebook US Airways continued to struggle with a faulty reservation-and-ticketing system Monday, and attempted to keep lines down at key airports by adding workers and encouraging travelers to use the Internet for flight check-ins. ""It's running better (Monday) than it did (Sunday), but we don't have it fully licked yet,"" US Airways President Scott Kirby said Monday afternoon in an interview. ""Right now, we are running the airline as if the kiosks are going to be down indefinitely."" Airports particularly hard hit by the computer problems: Las Vegas, Boston, Charlotte and Reagan Washington National. On Sunday, US Airways combined its reservation system with the America West system. The airlines merged in 2005, and integration of the reservation systems has been a major issue in creating a unified carrier. When the new system started over the weekend, it failed to communicate with ticketing kiosks at airports. That forced all passengers to check in at airport counters, creating massive lines. On a normal day, 40% of passengers would use kiosks to check in, Kirby said. Some passengers on Monday still faced lengthy waits: 90 minutes in Philadelphia, and 45 minutes in Charlotte, for example. But those times were better than Sunday, when waits at times lasted about two hours, Kirby said. According to airline performance tracker FlightStats, just 14% of US Airways Sunday flights scheduled to leave by early evening departed on time. On Monday, a day when domestic airlines were performing relatively well, US Airways had improved on-time departures to about 22% of its total flights, FlightStats said. Airline management had developed contingency plans for the computer switch, ran dress rehearsals and flew staff from Phoenix, the hometown airport for US Airways, to help at eastern airports, Kirby said. But the carrier hadn't specifically prepared for the possibility of a widespread kiosk problem. To alleviate passenger waits Monday morning, about five senior US Airways officials went to Charlotte to help check in passengers and direct lines. At Philadelphia, shuttle buses carried passengers to different terminals to balance passenger loads at ticket counters. Bill Navey, an engineer from Charlotte who flies US Airways every Sunday, says employees had been warning him for weeks not to travel on Sunday or Monday. He still flew Sunday, but arrived at the airport earlier than normal. ""There were lines everywhere. Nobody was directing traffic,"" Navey said. It took him more than an hour to get his boarding pass. ""It was awful,"" said business traveler Steven Friedman, who spent 90 minutes Sunday checking in at Washington Reagan National for an hour-long New York shuttle.

2007-03-01T07:00:00Z,RCMP Canadian Firearms Program Cancelled, CN$81 Million ,,,,,,,8.1E7,$,CAD,Canada,Project Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,http://www.thestar.com/news/2007/11/08/gun_registry_contract_cancelled_after_81m_spent.html?app=noRedirect,,Gun registry contract cancelled after $81M spent,"OTTAWA – Opposition parties expressed fury upon learning today the Conservative government had quietly cancelled an expensive computer software contract linked to the controversial federal gun registry and squandered millions in taxpayer dollars in the process.

With little fanfare, the contract was quietly cancelled in late March just before the end of the government's fiscal year.

A Public Works spokesman confirmed a deal was ironed out with CGI, the company developing the new software for the gun registry, that saw the contract cancelled for $10 million.

Since 2002, CGI, a Montreal-based IT outsourcing firm, was the key contractor that had been developing a computer system to replace the original federal arms registry software, which is becoming obsolete.

The price tag of the new system was criticized in the 2006 auditor general's report.

Following the report, the government decided to suspend contracts related to the computer programs.

By deciding to cancel the contract, the government was on the hook for $91 million, including $81 million already spent on the new computer program.

The Bloc Quebecois and Liberals said Thursday that by cutting the contract short, the Tory government has spent money without any purpose and is only attempting to further its plan to kill the gun registry altogether.

But the Public Works Department defended the move and dismissed any notion of secrecy on its part.

Jacques Gagnon, press secretary for Public Works Minister Michael Fortier, said the $10 million wasn't compensation, but rather to pay CGI for work already completed.

""The minister and the government are comfortable with the decision to cancel the contract. It's a good management decision to prevent wasting more money,"" Gagnon said.

Gagnon also dismissed any notion the move was done in secret and accused the opposition of rabble-rousing.

He said the department deals with thousands of contracts and many decisions are made without consulting Parliament.

The Bloc Quebecois' Serge Menard said that with the support of the other opposition parties, he will demand answers as soon as possible.

Menard questioned the government's decision to simply erase all the work already done by CGI by eliminating the deal.

""We put enough money in it, we put in too much. But we will always profit from the money we put into it,"" Menard said, accusing the Tories of trying to undermine the registry and discredit it.

Liberal MP Pablo Rodriguez agreed, calling on the government to discuss the decision.

Without the new computer system, the RCMP will be forced to continue using the older software. In a recent report on the aging system, the RCMP indicated it was capable of doing the job in the short-term, a period of about five-years.","Canada,Project Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

On Friday, 25 May, at the start of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, the mapping software in the San Diego Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facility used by controllers to guide flights for 21 airports in the Southern California region, failed for about an hour when staff attempted to update the maps.

Then on early Monday morning 5 March, there was a software failure in the ATOP (Advanced Technologies and Ocean Procedures) system that air traffic controllers in New York use to guide aircraft over the Atlantic Ocean. About two dozen flights were affected.

Until the FAAâ''s latest air traffic control (ATC) modernization effort called NextGen is complete â'' and that is not scheduled until 2025 according to current projects (and hopes) â'' and the current fragility of the current ATC computer and radar systems, one can expect more and more of these failures to occur. A complete system meltdown is probable in the next few years if there is a major computer or radar failure on a major travel weekend that happens during a spate of bad weather spanning several regions of the US. Just hope you arenâ''t flying when that happens.

This morning there were several articles on the proposed FAA NextGen system. One appeared in the LA Times here, the Boston Globe here and the Wall Street Journal (subscription) here.","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Transportation,,,Impact - Raw,airport/port/customs/systems"
2007-06-01T07:00:00Z,International Space Station Experiences Total Loss of Computers, Computer fixed after a few days ,,,6,days,144.0,,,,,Space,Operational Failure,Government,International,Space,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/space-flight/space-station-internal-nasa-reports-explain-origins-of-june-computer-crisis,,Space Station: Internal NASA Reports Explain Origins of June Computer Crisis,"4 October 2007--Aboard the International Space Station, the three Russian computers that control the station's orientation have been happily humming away now for several weeks. And that's proof that the crisis in June that crippled the ISS and bloodied the U.S.-Russian partnership that supports it, has been solved.

But the technological--and diplomatic--lessons of that crisis need to be fully understood and appreciated. Because if the failure had occurred on the way to Mars, say, it probably would have been fatal, and it will likely be the same international partnership that builds the hardware for a future Mars mission.

The critical computer systems, it turned out, had been designed, built, and operated incorrectly--and the failure was inevitable. Only being so relatively close to Earth, in range of resupply and support missions, saved the spacecraft from catastrophe.

During the first days of the computer failure in June, the station's atmosphere control system seized up. The failure also knocked out the autopilot's ability to fire maneuvering thrusters to hold the station steady during the undocking of the space shuttle, which had arrived on 10 June. The terse description in the NASA internal technical report on the crisis, obtained by IEEE Spectrum, put it this way: ”On 13 June, a complete shutdown of secondary power to all [three] central computer and terminal computer channels occurred, resulting in the loss of capability to control ISS Russian segment systems.”

Russian officials were quick to blame NASA for ”zapping their computers” with ”dirty” 28-volt power from a newly installed solar power wing. Another Russian explanation was that the expanded station structure (the main purpose of the shuttle visit) might be excessively charging up due to its orbital speed through Earth's magnetic field. These were the first of many bad guesses by top Russian program managers that would distract engineers trying to get at the real problem.

The initial assumption was that some external interference, such as noise on the power supply, was responsible for generating false commands inside the computer system. On the assumption that the bad commands were coming from inside a power-monitoring device, the crew bypassed it on two of the three downed computers, using jumper cables. By the time the shuttle undocked on 19 June, the computers began to function normally--or so it seemed. Replacement parts were quickly manifested on a robot supply ship, while ground engineers wrestled with the fundamental question of cause and effect.

Analysis teams still had to determine why the computers failed, and why the jumper cables seemed to fix the problem. More important, they needed to know whether the problem really was fixed, or whether something could again trigger the systemwide crash of the supposedly triply redundant architecture.

In the weeks that followed the crisis and apparent recovery, station commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and his fellow cosmonaut Oleg Kotov disassembled the boxes and cabling and inspected every angle of the hardware, occasionally assisted by their American crewmate, Clayton Anderson. Multiple scopes and probes had failed to find the flaw, but their eyes and fingers eventually did.

The connection pins from the power-monitoring device they'd bypassed earlier, they found, were wet--and corroded. The final report described the ”change in appearance” of fasteners on one box's connectors and noted ”the presence of deposits and residue on the housings, and residue and spots on the contact surfaces.”

Continuity checks found that specific wires, called command lines, in the cable coming out of the device had failed. And one of those lines had short-circuited. Also, in a shocking design flaw, there was a ”power off” command leading to all three of the supposedly redundant processing units. The line was designed to protect the main computers, which are downstream of the power monitor, from power glitches too great for normal power filters to protect against. It does so by turning the computers off when it senses trouble. But in a failure unanticipated by its designers, this one command path itself was able to kill all three processing units due to a single corrosion-induced short.

That discovery was a great relief to spacecraft controllers in Houston and Moscow. The bypass jumper cables were exactly what really was needed to circumvent the false ”power off” command, because they forced that command line to remain dormant. Using the cables did expose the computers to damage from real power surges, but by then the power system had settled into a benign and steady state.

But what caused the corrosion? The source was quickly identified: water condensation, one of the most frequent culprits in avionics problems. The NASA report says the damage ”presumably” was ”the result of repeated emissions of condensate from the air separation lines” of a nearby dehumidifier. Air flow and power usage were supposed to keep the computer cables warm enough to prevent water from condensing on them, but the dehumidifier had been malfunctioning, and its frequent on-off cycles led to surges of water vapor. Also, a stream of cold air from another location on the dehumidifier helped drive the cable temperatures occasionally below the dew point.

During the August shuttle visit, the Russians were able to turn stabilization control over to the American spaceship and tear down their old computer network. The boxes and cables were replaced with fresh units, built and supplied by the European Space Agency and sent up inside a recently launched robot supply ship.

”Upon removal of the old unit, the crew reported that there was cold condensate behind it,” notes an internal NASA ISS status report for 12 August obtained by IEEE Spectrum. ”Drops of humidity and mold were discovered. The unit itself is humid.”

To add to their headaches, the cosmonauts discovered that one of the new cables was about 40 centimeters shorter than the one it was supposed to replace--and it wouldn't reach. After careful visual inspection of the original cable , the cosmonauts decided there were no signs of corrosion, so there was no need to replace it. They also decided to rig a thermal barrier out of a surplus reference book and all-purpose gray tape. As a last step, they removed the jumper cables, verified the system was functional, and closed the access panels.

It is dismaying that after decades of experience with manned space stations, Russian space engineers still couldn't keep unwanted condensation at bay. But what's worse is that they designed circuitry that would allow one spot of corrosion to fell a supposedly triply redundant control computer complex. Another cause for dismay is that when trouble did develop, the Russians' first instinct was to blame their American partners. Such deficiencies need to be worked out in the years ahead, on the space station, before both the technology and the diplomacy can be thought reliable enough for far-ranging missions that replacement shipments wouldn't be able to reach.","Space,Operational Failure,Government,International,Space,,,Impact - Raw"
2007-06-01T07:00:00Z,United Airlines Flight and Dispatch Goes Down, United Flights grounded worldwide for two hours ,,,2,hours,2,,,,,Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/airline_systems_meltdowns,,Airline Systems Meltdowns,"Yesterday morning, United Airlines flight and maintenance dispatch system operating at O'Hare in Chicago went down for about two hours grounding all flights world-wide. United, the world's second largest airline, said that 268 domestic and international flights were delayed, and 24 domestic flights were canceled. According to reports, the Unimatic dispatch system that shut down dispatches flight crews,determines the weight and balance of an aircraft, relays flight plans and weather to pilots and confirms that maintenance checks have been carried out as required.

More interesting is that not only does United not know what caused the malfunction, but that the dispatch system's back-up also failed for unknown reasons. Apparently a major hardware upgrade was made on the 18th of May, but it is not known whether this had anything to do with the problems experienced.

Last month, on the 27th of May, All Nippon Airways' (ANA) integrated computer system that controls reservations, boarding procedures and luggage flows for domestic flights and delivers the information to computer terminals at airports across Japan malfunctioned which led to the cancellation of 131 flights and affected over 70,000 passengers. As in the United case above, back-up systems didn't seem to kick in properly. Problems continued into the next day, with another flight canceled and another nine delayed. ANA blamed the problem on the installation of three new computers the previous week.

You may also remember that in March of this year, US Airways had extensive trouble rolling out an integrated reservation system as well.

I am waiting for the perfect storm to occur in the US: one airline loses its dispatch system while another loses its dispatch system while the FAA loses its radar systems, all on a Friday afternoon with bad weather across the nation. Should be a sight to behold. Given the increased complexity of these types of systems, and the overall fragility of the air traffic control system, this should not be unexpected.

Update: This afternoon United Airlines said that the cause of the problem was an operational error during routine system testing. Then, during the recovery, a hardware error occurred.

Update 2: AP is reporting that an employee mistake caused the problems with the Unimatic and the back-up system.","Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,airport/port/customs/systems"

Jul 06, 2007









The Health Service Executive has abandoned roll-out of its controversial PPARS computer system.

The cost of PPARS has already gone from €9 million to €130 million.

The HSE board said it has endorsed a decision to introduce a replacement comprehensive system for human resources information and payroll administration.

It refers to PPARS as 'paused'. That system was introduced progressively by regional health boards before the HSE came into being in 2005. It was never uniform across the country.

The Department of Finance will be involved in decisions on any new system.

The PPARS system has been subject to major controversy about its efficiency. The spiral in costs included large consultancy fees.

One of PPARS more celebrated mistakes was when it overpaid a HSE employee by €1 million.

For whatever the next system is there should be an independent group set out from out side of the HSE and local government to keep check on where all the funds are being spent.

Posted

The ACT Emergency Services Agency (ESA) says it has been forced to write off millions of dollars after deciding to dump a high-tech fire fighting satellite system.

ESA Commissioner Gregor Manson says the Firelink system is just too sophisticated for the ACT's needs.

""We've really bought a sledgehammer to peel peanuts,"" he said.

The service has now been dumped at a cost to the taxpayer of $4.5 million.

And Commissioner Manson is critical of the way his predecessors handled the project.

""This program was not a priority for the agency when volunteers were without raincoats,"" he said.

He says the withdrawal has been done as part of a new business plan for the ESA, which will focus on providing proper governance and procurement systems.

Commissioner Mandson says he regrets that there had been hopeful reporting of the system, and that millions of dollars were spent on Firelink system instead of vital equipment.

He says the problems associated with Firelink did not lie within the system itself.

""It's more than we need, and it's not doing exactly the right job that we need for the agency,"" he said.

Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa called for an investigation as carriers dealt with the fallout from Saturday's computer crash, which stranded more than 20,000 inbound travelers in the terminal and on planes.

At least four outbound international flights were delayed for an hour or more, according the airport's Web site.

One Zurich-bound Swiss International Air Lines plane was expected to depart at around noon Sunday, some 14 hours after its scheduled departure time, airline spokeswoman Andrea Kreuzer said.

""We were not able to prepare the aircraft,"" Kreuzer said.

Thousands of passengers were kept on planes or in airport terminals after customs department computers containing travelers' identities and law enforcement records went down, preventing authorities from screening people arriving in the U.S.

""We just can't take a risk knowing that one bad guy can harm our country significantly,"" said U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Mike Fleming.

On Sunday, international flights were arriving on time and travelers coming to the U.S. were making it smoothy through the airport's checkpoints, Fleming said.

""So far, it's normal operations,"" Fleming said.

Passengers were kept on planes starting at 2:30 p.m. Saturday after the terminals that normally accept international passengers became full because the previous arrivals couldn't be processed.

The hardware malfunction was repaired by 11:45 p.m., Fleming said. But it took officials until around 4 a.m. Sunday to finish processing the backlog of incoming passengers.

""This is the Third World,"" said Irish tourist Caroline O'Rourke, who spent six hours on the tarmac after her 12-hour flight. ""This is just disgraceful.""

Three people were transported to local hospitals after they fell ill while waiting in the terminals, the Los Angeles Fire Department reported.

Airport officials said the stranded planes were connected to ground power and passengers had access to food, water and bathrooms during the hours it took to repair the computer system.

""We've had outages in the past, but they haven't taken nearly as long to resolve,"" Fleming said. ""This was unprecedented in terms of impact.""","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Customs,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,airport/port/customs/systems"

2007-08-01T07:00:00Z,New $95 Million LA United School District Payroll System Doesn't Work," Tens of thousands of teachers, cafeteria workers, classroom aides and others have been underpaid, overpaid or not paid at all ",,,,,,50000,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Education,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/la_school_system_blunder,,LA School System BLUNDER,"I have long argued that the IT community needs to separate IT failures from blunders.

Most organizations do not have enough IT project failures. The reason I say this is that, in my experience, most project cancellations (or escalations for that matter) are not true failures but instead represent blunders. There is a big difference. A project failure is one in which most project decisions and actions were correct at the time, but for some reason the project didn't work out. It is a professional project -- the project risks were assessed, managed, and accepted where required; the assumptions were checked; success criteria were defined; the plan was estimated and funded well; the stakeholders participated; and so on.

Project blunders, which I contend most project overruns and cancellations are, arise from Dilbert-like approaches to project management and implementation. There is little or no risk management, the project plan is a fantasy, stakeholder concerns are given short shrift, and on and on.

Well, in a distressingly familiar story in today's LA Times, yet another IT blunder is described. The lede paragraph reads as follows:

Since launching a $95-million computer system six months ago, the Los Angeles Unified School District has been beset by programming glitches, hardware crashes and mistakes by hurriedly trained clerical staff. The result: tens of thousands of teachers, cafeteria workers, classroom aides and others have been underpaid, overpaid or not paid at all.

Sounds like a blunder to me.

Let's see, there are some 14,500 school districts in the United States, along with over 4,000 colleges and universities. I would guess, 99.9% have automated payroll systems. I would also hazard that packaged payroll systems have been around since the mid-1960s - the LA's own payroll system has been around since 1967 or so.

And yet, after all this experience, a school system - even as large as LA's with 100,000 employees - cannot get a payroll system to work properly? INEXCUSABLE.

When the problems first appeared, it was claimed that only a small percentage of employees were affected. Now it looks like about 50% have been affected - so much for the effectiveness of their system testing.

""Let me apologize officially for this failure.There is no excuse for it. I apologize to anyone who has been hurt by this, "" so said LA's school district Supt. David L. Brewer.

An apology, not matter how sincere, won't pay the bills. And LA taxpayers should refuse to pay for this IT blunder either.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Education,,,Impact - Raw,payroll"

The Times went on to say that Edward Leigh, the Tory MP who chaired the review committee, said the farmers' payment project was â''a masterclass in bad decision-making, poor planning, incomplete testing of IT controls, confused lines of responsibility, scant objective management information and a failure by the management team to face up to the unfolding crisis.â'' Sounds like a classic IT blunder to me.

The PAC report listed some 15 lessons learned, or maybe better put, not learned. As an example, this is from number 14:

""The implementation of the single payment scheme was subject to four Office of Government Commerce Gateway Reviews between May 2004 and February 2006, and three of these Reviews assessed the programme as ""red"". Development work on the computer system nevertheless continued and no contingency plan was invoked, despite limited confidence that the system would be ready on time. If 'red' reviews are to be taken seriously, departments need to be explicit about the circumstances in which they would lead to fundamental review or termination of a project.""

Begun in 1997, the program was meant to upgrade the electronics and some other bits of 11 of these 1960s-era helicopters (Defence calls them ""mature helicopters"") over five years for an original cost of AU$745 million; the cost to complete is now estimated to range around AU$1.5 billion. Up until a few weeks ago, the Australian Defence Department said their Super Seasprites would become operational in 2008, but that date has now been slipped to 2011.

Software problems related to the Seasprite's avionics and flight control software have been at the root of many of the delays and cost overruns. The problems have been so severe that last year the helo was grounded because, according to Defence Minister Brendan Nelson, ""You could not have 100 per cent confidence in the software program that supports the pilot flying the helicopter to 100 per cent safety.""

According to Department of Defence's Portfolio Budget Statement 2007-2008, ""The main sustainment risks to the Super Seasprite include the automatic flight control system issue, mission computer shortcomings, and a lack of customer confidence in the platform brought about by the extended flight suspension and ongoing technical issues."" Oh, that's all?

The latest schedule slip was due to software testing and integration problems to the helo's mission system software. IT mercy rule, anyone?

Wachovia apologized to Martins, and promptly blamed the letter and the erroneous amount on a word processing error - the number supposedly owed actually matched the gentleman's bank account number.

A similar computer typo problem, but with real side-effects happened last week in Carver County, Minnesota. Eric Mattson received a real estate assessment notice stating that his 4,400 square foot vacant lot was being assessed at a market value of $189,000,000 (or $42,955 per square foot) and would he please fork over the $2.5 million in property tax he owed. Since is about 10 times the value of prime property in London, which is the most expensive property in the world ($4,585 per square foot), Mattson had a good laugh and called the assessor's office about the obvious error.

The assessor's office wasn't laughing. It was indeed an error, but the County had already budgeted and spent the money.

According to the story in the Minnesota Star Tribune, there was change in the property's status which required a change in its tax status. In August, a ""clerk filled in the $18,900 proposed valuation, but then mistakenly hit the key to exit the program. The computer added four zeros to fill out the nine numerical spaces required by the software, thus indicating the value was $189,000,000.""

Several officials questioned the windfall, but the tax office assured everyone that it was true; that is, until Mattson complained.

Now the County is trying to figure out how to make up for the shortfall, like cutting back on services to raising taxes. The issue will be debated at a meeting on Tuesday.

LAUSD officials furthermore say that to get to their projected error rate of 0.5 percent of monthly certified paychecks, teachers will have to give up the ability to get annualized pay (i.e., receiving twelve paychecks a year, instead of ten).

The cost of the development, originally estimated at â'¿240 million has jumped to an estimated â'¿950 million, and sparked a government review of the project in August.

About â'¿155 million has been spent so far, and cancellation the program is likely to cost â'¿50 million in cancellation fees. The government said that it will try to salvage part of the system to track prisoners in prisons.

On the C-NOMIS website, it says, ""The new Offender Management Model introduces the four Cs:

* continuity

* consistency

* commitment

* consolidation.""

I guess a fifth C for cock-up, needs to be added to the list, which is better I guess than the other C, conspiracy.

The article points out a few of the ""challenges"" confronting the program like making a 63.8 million line of code system work, let alone be hacker proof.

One bit of the story caught my eye, however. The supposedly original 2003 estimate by the Army was for FCS to require 33.7 million lines of code; it has now blossomed to a current estimate of 63.8 million lines of code. However, Boeing, the program's lead contractor, claims that the original estimate was for actually 55 million lines of code, implying code growth isn't that bad.

The reason I find this curious is that the 33.7 million lines of code estimate has been around for several years, and appears in Congressional testimony many, many times. That number gave lots of folks pause in 2003, since the Army claimed at the time that it would complete FCS in five and a half-years. Questions were raised then about whether that amount of code could be developed in that time frame, but the ever-confident Army said it could be accomplished.

I have never heard or seen that 55 million lines of code number ever mentioned before this article. If that was the true estimate at proposal time, did the contractor and the Army ""forget"" to let Congress, the Governmental Accountability Office (GAO), and a whole bunch of other people know the true system size so that they wouldn't ask questions in 2003 like, ""Tell me again how you plan to develop and integrate an average of 10 million lines of native and commercial-off-the-shelf software per year over each of the next five years?"" ""Can you point to any military software-intensive development of 10 million lines of code successfully completed in 5 years?"" ""Can you prove you are not legally insane?""

As Ricky used to say to Lucy, ""Lucy, you got some explaining to do."" If not Boeing, then certainly the Army needs to explain where this 55 million lines of code number came from, if it was the originally proposed number, and why it hasn't ever been disclosed before.","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency"

Transactions stopped on contracts expiring in March at 10:59 a.m. local time, the bourse said in a faxed statement. Normal trading hours are 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. Monday to Friday, with about 650 billion yen ($6 billion) in securities changing hands each day.

The stoppage may further damage a reputation tarnished by glitches during the past three years, as the Tokyo exchange prepares to go public and explore alliances to grab a larger share of global trading.

``It just shows that the TSE has done a poor job in revamping its operations and systems,'' said Mitsushige Akino, who overseas about $560 million in assets as chief investment officer at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo. ``Japan has a lot of catching up to do.''

The exchange is examining the cause of the stoppage along with system developer Fujitsu Ltd., said Masayuki Hirose, director of the bourse's information technology department. Officials will decide by the evening of Monday Feb. 11 if futures trading can resume the following day, Hirose said. Markets are closed on Feb. 11 for a holiday.

``There are market participants who would like to change their positions before the three-day holiday and the glitch will somewhat affect afternoon trading,'' said Masanori Ikunaga, who helps manage $4.1 billion at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co.

Hirose declined to say if the exchange will seek compensation from Fujitsu for the malfunction of the trading system, which was installed on Jan. 15.

The bourse halted all trading for the first time in November 2005 after a system failure. A fault on Dec. 8, 2005, prevented Mizuho Securities Co. from canceling a trading error, initially costing the brokerage 40.5 billion yen ($377 million).

Fujitsu shares reversed morning gains to fall as much as 2.6 percent. Yasuhiko Yodo, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Fujitsu, declined to comment on today's stoppage.

The Nikkei 225 Stock Average slumped 3.6 percent this week, while the Topix dropped 3.7 percent.

2008-02-01T07:00:00Z,Software Update Crashes London Heathrow T4 Baggage System ," Baggage for 4,000 passengers affected ",,,,,,4000,,,,UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/baggage_meltdown_at_heathrow,,Baggage Meltdown at Heathrow,"A computer malfunction in the baggage system at London Heathrow's Terminal 4 has caused chaos for over 4,000 passengers flying British Airways (BA) and several others over the past several days. It appears that about noon Tuesday, a software upgrade to Terminal 4's computerized baggage handling system caused the the belts that route and or transfer luggage from check-in desks to specific aircraft luggage loading and off-loading areas to stop working.

As a result, BA told all of its economy class passengers who were leaving Terminal 4 (which handles long-haul flights to other countries) or transferring to other flights at the terminal that they could not check in anything but a small carry on bag. Business class and first class passengers were not affected (a travel class-specific software bug - how interesting). It must have been very thrilling for those passengers who were already on long-haul flights and landed at Heathrow only to be told they could go, but their luggage had to stay.

BA economy passengers were told they could try to ship their luggage to their destinations by other means, wait for some future BA flight when the system was working, try to get on another airline (BA said it would try to get other airlines to honor their tickets) or get a refund. Of course, I guess you could always upgrade if there was room.

The other airlines like Qantas, KLM and Air Malta that also use Terminal 4 quickly decided to manually moved passenger luggage, and therefore were only temporarily affected. BA claimed that the sheer quantity of their luggage meant this was not possible except for the aforementioned business and first class passengers.

As of today, the baggage system seems to be working again, except for transfer passengers. Heathrow has always been an awful place to transfer flights - this latest problem just adds to its notoriety, and a desire of experienced passengers to avoid Heathrow (and BA) at all costs.

According to reports, this is the 10th baggage system breakdown at Heathrow since last May.

In what could have been better timing for BA, while this situation was unfolding, it was announced that BA was the second worst airline in Europe for losing bags: 26.5 bags for every 1,000 passengers. Only TAP, the Portuguese carrier, lost more, some 27.8 bags per 1,000 passengers.

BA next announced a Â£12 fuel surcharge increase. As the Telegraph once more reported, that from ""Monday, the surcharge for long-haul flights of less than nine hours will rise from Â£96 for a return flight to Â£106. For return long-haul flights of more than nine hours, the charge will increase from Â£116 to Â£128.""

BA, with more exquisite timing, unveiled its new Terminal 5 to the press, which is supposedly going to solve the passenger baggage system problem once and for all. As the Telegraph reported, ""Gary Ranns, lounges manager at British Airways, said: 'Terminal 5 will be a fantastic experience. It will make travelling a pleasure again and not a chore.' "" Given what was happening over at Terminal 4 at the time, Ranns might have chosen better language.

And finally, to add to the positive publicity, BA pilots also have decided today that they would go on strike over the coming Easter holidays, and just before when Terminal 5 is supposed to open on 27 March.

Of course, BA apologizes for any inconvenience.

UPDATE: Friday, 22 February, BA announced everything was back to ""normal"" at Terminal 4 - which means routine chaos rather than computer enhanced chaos.","UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,airport/port/customs/systems"

As of 3:30 pm EST, BlackBerry wireless communications service in North America has gone dark, according to a report from the Associated Press. Service provider AT&T told the AP that the outage is affecting all wireless carriers.

The Reuters news agency reports that Research in Motion (RIM), the Canadian maker of BlackBerry smart phones, has sent e-mail to its customers that its service had experienced a ""critical severity outage"" on Monday.

""This is an emergency notification regarding the current BlackBerry Infrastructure outage,"" RIM support account manager Bryan Simpson said in the e-mail message, according to Reuters.

The Reuters report notes that the e-mail note sent by RIM's Simpson made no mention of the cause of the outage or when service might be restored.

A similar service interruption occurred last April, leaving thousands of BlackBerry users without access to wireless e-mail.

2008-03-01T07:00:00Z,Waste Management Sues SAP for  Over $450 Million for Failed ERP Project, Really wants $1 Billion for what it calls fraudulent sales scheme ,,,,,,,1.0E9,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Commercial,,,Unknown,http://www.infoworld.com/article/2648303/applications/waste-management-sues-sap-over-erp-implementation.html,,Waste Management sues SAP over ERP implementation,"The trash-disposal giant Waste Management is suing SAP, saying top SAP executives participated in a fraudulent sales scheme that resulted in a failed ERP (enterprise resource planning) implementation.

Waste Management said it is seeking recovery of more than $100 million in project expenses as well as ""the savings and benefits that the SAP software was promised to deliver to Waste Management.""

An SAP spokesman said Thursday that ""as a matter of policy SAP does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

[ Digital Spotlight: Enterprise mobile app strategies that work. | Keep up on key mobile developments and insights with the Mobile Computing newsletter. ]

In 2005, Waste Management was looking for a new revenue management system, according to a company statement. ""SAP proposed its Waste and Recycling product and claimed it was a tested, working solution that had been developed with the needs of Waste Management in mind,"" the Waste Management statement reads in part.

SAP promised that the software could be fully implemented throughout all of Waste Management within 18 months, according to the statement.

""From the beginning, SAP assured Waste Management that its software was an 'out-of-the-box' solution that would meet Waste Management's needs without any customization or enhancements,"" the statement reads. ""Unfortunately, Waste Management ultimately learned that these representations were not true.""

Waste Management said product demonstrations by SAP prior to the deal employed ""'fake software environments, even though these demonstrations were represented to be the actual software.""

Waste Management's original complaint, filed in Harris County, Texas district court, said senior SAP executives, including SAP Americas' president and CEO, Bill McDermott, participated in the ""rigged and manipulated"" demos.

The company filed suit against SAP Americas and SAP AG on March 20 after ""months of discussions with SAP and a recent consensual, three-day mediation that SAP ended after day two,"" according to the statement.

The action followed a lengthy initial courtship and falling out between the companies, detailed at length in Waste Management's court filing.

SAP officials held meetings with the company throughout the summer and fall of 2005, according to the complaint. Shai Agassi, a former executive board member, was among the SAP executives present at one meeting on June 17, 2005, in Walldorf, Germany, according to the complaint.

""At that meeting, SAP AG executives and engineers represented that the software was a mature solution and conducted a demonstration consisting of what they represented was the actual SAP Waste and Recycling software,"" the complaint states. The company later discovered that the software was a ""mock-up version of that software intended to deceive Waste Management,"" according to the complaint. SAP has admitted to this in ""internal documents,"" the complaint states.

SAP also demonstrated the ""fake software"" at subsequent sales presentations, according to the complaint.

Waste Management ultimately signed a sales pact with SAP on Oct. 3, 2005, according to the court filing.

""Almost immediately following execution of the agreements, the SAP implementation team discovered significant 'gaps' between the software's functionality and Waste Management's business requirements,"" it states.

""Waste Management has discovered that these gaps were already known to the product development team in Germany even before the SLA was signed. Instead of admitting what it knew at the time -- that the software lacked basic functionality to run Waste Management's business -- SAP undertook an elaborate fraud to perpetuate the original fraud and to recover additional money from Waste Management.""

Members of SAP's implementation team blamed Waste Management for the functional gaps and submitted change orders requiring that Waste Management pay for fixing them, according to the complaint.

In addition, the complaint alleges, SAP originally promised that a pilot phase in New Mexico would be up and running by Dec. 15, 2006, ""but it is not even close to being completed today.""

Eventually, SAP conducted a ""Solutions Review"" and by summer 2007 determined the software was not an ""enterprise solution"" for Waste Management's needs, according to the complaint.

SAP said that if Waste Management wished to have the software implemented on a companywide basis, it would have to ""start over"" and agree to let SAP build a new version of the product with an updated version of its enterprise application platform, according to the complaint.

""SAP's 2007 proposal is precisely the kind of risky, expensive and time-consuming project that Waste Management rejected from other companies two years earlier,"" the complaint states. ""Indeed, the development project that SAP proposed would drastically lengthen the implementation timetable from the original December 2007 end-date to an end-date sometime in 2010 without any assurance of success.""

A Waste Management spokeswoman said the company would have no comment beyond the statement and complaint.","US,Project Failure,Commercial,,,Unknown,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,ERP"

Trying to stem more problems for occurring, BA canceled 20% of its flights before the day began. It also encouraged passengers to fly only with hand luggage. I guess that is better than what happened yesterday when passengers on a number of flights got off at their destination and only then were told that their luggage hadn't been put on the plane.

The Guardian has a story about the breakdown that happened yesterday - it describes ""a catalogue of errors led by serious problems with BA's new baggage sorting regime (that) caused the entire system to collapse within hours."" It started with ""a lack of staff spaces in a specially-designated car park"" for baggage system operators, followed quickly by baggage system operators ""unable to log on to the computer system, which caused three flights to 'cut and run' and fly off without bags - creating the first backlog of the day."" It degenerated from there.

Other new Terminal 5 IT systems like the one that is supposed to help allocate staff resources to problem areas in an event of a crisis occurring, failed to work as expected as well.

Today, the problems continue, mostly BA said, caused by the ""knock-on"" effects of yesterday's fiasco. The head of strategy for BAA, the airport operator, claimed that, ""We're very comfortable in the performance of the (baggage) system itself ..."" but that it was the baggage system operators' fault for the problems that were being experienced. Maybe next time, BAA should create a baggage system that can operate completely without any human intervention. I know, get some robots!

More flights are going to be canceled over the weekend, in hopes of getting over the ""teething problems.""

BA chief executive Willie Walsh finally figured out that his ""things are great"" view of yesterday didn't sync with reality. So, Walsh did what all CEOs do, he accepted responsibility without really accepting responsibility. This is what Walsh told the Guardian:

"" 'I am accepting responsibility that the buck stops with me. ... It was definitely not our finest hour. Maybe we set our expectations too high. We clearly made mistakes but I am absolutely determined to make this work.' ""

When asked whether he would resign, he said, ""No, I am not.""

Maybe things will be better for passengers by next week, if they can get to the airport. London Underground staff are vowing to go on strike for three days next week which will close down the Tube, and make traveling in the London area a right shambolic mess.","UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,airport/port/customs/systems"

The story in the Post says that, ""The computer in question was used to monitor chemical and diagnostic data from one of the facility's primary control systems, and the software update was designed to synchronize data on both systems. According to a report filed with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, when the updated computer rebooted, it reset the data on the control system, causing safety systems to errantly interpret the lack of data as a drop in water reservoirs that cool the plant's radioactive nuclear fuel rods. As a result, automated safety systems at the plant triggered a shutdown.""

As outlined in the story, company technicians were aware that there was full two-way communication between some of the computers on the plant's corporate and control networks. However, the engineer who installed the update was not aware that that the software was designed to synchronize data between machines on both networks, or that a reboot in the business system computer would force a similar reset in the control system machine.

The company has now physically removed the connections between the control and business systems.

The reason?

According to Director of the Census Steve H. Murdock's testimony before the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science, ""the problem with the FDCA (Field Data Collection Automation) program was due to a lack of communication between the Census Bureau and the prime contractor for FDCA, and to difficulties the contractor had in developing the full scope of the project within our deadlines. From the beginning, we did not effectively convey to the contractor the complexity of census operations, and the detailed requirements that needed to be fulfilled in order to complete the operations that FDCA covers.""

In U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos M. Gutierrez testimony, he said that, ""In 2007, the Address Canvassing dress rehearsal was conducted, at which time development and scoping problems emerged. Reports from the Census Bureauâ''s field staff, consultants from the non-profit MITRE Corporation working for the Bureau, and the Government Accountability Office confirmed these problems. The departmentâ''s Inspector General also raised concerns.""

""In late 2007 and early 2008, more than 400 new or clarified technical requirements were identified by the Census Bureau. Upon the realization of the large scope of requirement changes, Census Director Murdock established the 2010 Census FDCA Risk Reduction Task Force, to begin to propose and evaluate options to keep the FDCA program on track. These efforts served to clarify the issues and confirm the urgent need for action.""

The action was to punt (and bad mouth the contractor as much as possible even as the Bureau ""accepted responsibility"").

Gutierrez's testimony, as damning as it is, fails to mention that both technical and management issues with the handhelds were raised well before May of 2007 - all the May 2007 dress rehearsal did is to confirm them. Even as the sirens were going off that major trouble was brewing and that urgent action was required to be taken by July 2007 at the very latest, the Census Bureau and especially Gutierrez himself kept their collective heads in the sand, all the while claiming the project was moving along smartly, and that the critics (like me) were unjustifiably bashing the program.

Guess I wasn't, after all.

So, another $2.2 billion to $3 billion will be spent on top of the $11 billion already allocated to complete the census. What the hell, it's only taxpayer money.

Kudos to the Census Bureau for creating yet another case study on how not to manage a large scale software project in government. A classic IT blunder and debacle all rolled into one.

That said, let's hope that Congress demands a thorough, open and detailed analysis of this project be under taken now - before the files are ""lost"" - and a plan developed outlining how the Census plans to automate the 2020 census actually using for once the lessons learned.

Normal meant a new ""normal,"" not the old ""normal"" like that at Terminal 4 where baggage system problems was the norm.

Well, it looks like the new normal is the same as the old normal.

BA announced earlier today that, ""the BAA baggage system in Terminal 5 has suffered another computer problem today, which has caused disruption to British Airways flights.""

""We are urging BAA to resolve these issues as soon as possible. Todayâ''s failure affects the baggage reconciliation system. This ensures that for security reasons we do not load any bags onto the aircraft where the passenger is not travelling.""

""This means we have to manually reconcile bags for each flight which takes considerably more time than using the automated system. As a result this has led to flight delays and we have had to make a number of shorthaul cancellations.""

""We apologise to passengers for the inconvenience.""

BAA, the airport operator, also issued an apology: ""This morning, a software problem has arisen in the baggage system at T5. This is entirely BAA's responsibility. We apologise to British Airways and all passengers who have been affected and can assure them that our specialist staff are working hard to resolve the problem and keep disruption to BA's operation to a minimum. While we know what the problem is, and have a potential solution, we are having to carefully consider how and when we apply this, to avoid further problems. We will provide further updates when appropriate.""

It is never a good thing when you think your software fix may make things worse rather than better.

At least 12 flights were canceled today, and many flights were delayed for three hours or more.

Since the new terminal opened, over 400 flights have been canceled, at least 28,000 bags have been ""mis-placed"" and are being sorted in Milan, Gatwick, Manchester, Scotland, and the US, and the estimated costs to BA are at least $50 million. No word on whether BA will be asking BAA for compensation.

Life will get more interesting at the end of the month when most of the remainder of BA flights will move from Terminal 4 to Terminal 5. Of course, when the other airlines of the SkyTeam (Aeroflot, Air France, Alitalia, Bmi, Continental, CSA, Delta, Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air and Northwest Airlines) move into the space vacated by BA in Terminal 4. Given all the shuffling, I think it would be wise to avoid Heathrow until the end of the year.

2008-05-01T07:00:00Z,Waste Management Sues SAP for more than $100 Million Over Failed ERP Implementation , Eventual cost was at leat $80 million (see May 2010 settlement) ,,,,,,,8.0E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Commercial,,,Unknown,http://www.computerworld.com/article/2536212/enterprise-applications/waste-management-sues-sap-over-erp-implementation.html,,Waste Management sues SAP over ERP implementation,"Trash-disposal company Waste Management Inc. is suing SAP AG, saying top SAP executives participated in a fraudulent sales scheme that resulted in a failed ERP implementation.

Houston-based Waste Management said it is seeking recovery of more than $100 million in project expenses, as well as ""the savings and benefits that the SAP software was promised to deliver to Waste Management.""

An SAP spokesman said via e-mail today that ""as a matter of policy SAP does not comment on ongoing litigation.""

A Waste Management spokeswoman said the company would have no comment beyond the statement and complaint.

In 2005, Waste Management was looking for a new revenue management system, according to a company statement. ""SAP proposed its Waste and Recycling product and claimed it was a tested, working solution that had been developed with the needs of Waste Management in mind,"" the Waste Management statement reads in part.

SAP promised that the software could be fully implemented throughout all of Waste Management within 18 months, according to the statement.

""From the beginning, SAP assured Waste Management that its software was an 'out-of-the-box' solution that would meet Waste Management's needs without any customization or enhancements,"" the statement reads. ""Unfortunately, Waste Management ultimately learned that these representations were not true.""

Waste Management said product demonstrations by SAP prior to the deal employed ""fake software environments, even though these demonstrations were represented to be the actual software.""

Waste Management's original complaint, filed in Harris County, Texas, district court, said senior SAP executives, including SAP Americas president and CEO Bill McDermott, participated in the ""rigged and manipulated"" demos.

The company filed suit against SAP Americas and SAP AG on March 20 after ""months of discussions with SAP and a recent consensual, three-day mediation that SAP ended after Day Two,"" according to the statement.

The action followed a lengthy initial courtship and falling out between the companies, detailed at length in Waste Management's court filing.

SAP officials held meetings with the company throughout the summer and fall of 2005, according to the complaint. Shai Agassi, a former executive board member, was among the SAP executives present at one meeting on June 17, 2005, in Walldorf, Germany, according to the complaint.

""At that meeting, SAP AG executives and engineers represented that the software was a mature solution and conducted a demonstration consisting of what they represented was the actual SAP Waste and Recycling software,"" the complaint states. The company later discovered that the software was a ""mock-up version of that software intended to deceive Waste Management,"" according to the complaint. SAP has admitted to this in ""internal documents,"" the complaint states.

SAP also demonstrated the ""fake software"" at subsequent sales presentations, according to the complaint.

Waste Management ultimately signed a sales pact with SAP on Oct. 3, 2005, according to the court filing.

""Almost immediately following execution of the agreements, the SAP implementation team discovered significant 'gaps' between the software's functionality and Waste Management's business requirements,"" it states.

""Waste Management has discovered that these gaps were already known to the product development team in Germany even before the SLA was signed. Instead of admitting what it knew at the time -- that the software lacked basic functionality to run Waste Management's business -- SAP undertook an elaborate fraud to perpetuate the original fraud and to recover additional money from Waste Management.""

Members of SAP's implementation team blamed Waste Management for the functional gaps and submitted change orders requiring that Waste Management pay for fixing them, according to the complaint.

In addition, the complaint alleges, SAP originally promised that a pilot phase in New Mexico would be up and running by Dec. 15, 2006, ""but it is not even close to being completed today.""

Eventually, SAP conducted a ""Solutions Review"" and by summer 2007 determined the software was not an ""enterprise solution"" for Waste Management's needs, according to the complaint.

SAP said that if Waste Management wanted to have the software implemented on a companywide basis, it would have to ""start over"" and agree to let SAP build a new version of the product with an updated version of its enterprise application platform, according to the complaint.

""SAP's 2007 proposal is precisely the kind of risky, expensive and time-consuming project that Waste Management rejected from other companies two years earlier,"" the complaint states. ""Indeed, the development project that SAP proposed would drastically lengthen the implementation timetable from the original December 2007 end-date to an end-date sometime in 2010 without any assurance of success.""","US,Project Failure,Commercial,,,Unknown,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,ERP"

British Gas, according to the story, says the billing project ""was the cause of the appalling customer service that lost British Gas hundreds of thousands of customers, a High Court writ from Centrica [the parent company of British Gas] says.""

British Gas claims that it had to employ 2,500 extra staff to help resolve the billing problems created.

The story goes on, ""The writ says the problems could be traced back to 2002, when Centrica engaged Accenture to provide a new IT system. Project Jupiter was to bring together British Gasâ''s electricity and gas-billing schemes into one system capable of handling 250,000 meter readings and 200,000 bills a day. The price was Â£317m, with Accenture being paid from the Â£397m in savings that British Gas expected from the new system over a decade.""

""Various glitches arose, but the two sides agreed a revised contract in March 2006 under which Accenture provided guarantees that a software upgrade would work. According to Centrica, it did not,"" the story says.

An older article on the issues involved as reported in Computing can be found here.

The Times story also includes Accenture's response:

""An Accenture spokesman said that Centrica 'conducted extensive testing' on the system before it was handed over. He added: 'We are confident, based on the facts of the situation, that this claim is baseless and without merit. Accenture will vigorously defend the High Court proceedings.' ""

â''Accenture delivered the system at the end of 2005. The system we delivered met all of our commitments and the specifications that Centrica set; it was delivered on the agreed timeline and budget.â''

2008-07-01T07:00:00Z,Levi Strauss Reports 2nd Quarter Profits Hurt by ERP Integration That Stopped Orders for a Week, Cost hit was $47 Million ,,,1,weeks,168.0,,4.7E7,$,USD,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,http://www.accountingweb.com/topic/technology/levi-strauss-blames-profit-drop-sap-enterprise-software-system,,Levi Strauss blames profit drop on SAP enterprise software system,"In its 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the quarter that ended on May 25 this year, Levi Strauss said the $47 million drop in profits from the equivalent period last year reflected its implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system at the beginning of the quarter. Our sister site, AccountingWEB.co.uk filed this report.

Without naming the supplier, the company explained, ""Order fulfillment issues and higher operating expenses related to the implementation and stabilization of the system negatively impacted our net revenue and operating income.""

The jeans maker's decision to implement SAP was widely trumpeted in trade reports in 2003, although more recently the CFO who spearheaded the implementation recently left the organization with much less fanfare.

The 10-Q filing explains that the ERP system is being implemented in phases. Having installed it in several Asia-Pacific subsidiaries, the company began implementing SAP in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2008.

One of the project's objectives, the company explained, was to improve controls over certain financial reporting processes that were previously done manually.

But, subsequent to the U.S. implementation, ""We encountered issues with the U.S. ERP system which caused us to further revise our internal control process and procedures in order to correct and supplement our processing capabilities within the new system,"" the company said.

These changes materially affected the internal financial reporting controls at Levi Strauss during the quarter. In spite of the problems, Levi Strauss said it would continue to implement the ERP system in the coming years, adding: ""We continue to believe that the ERP system will simplify and strengthen our system of internal control over financial reporting.""

During what it calls the ERP ""stabilization period,"" the company had to suspend shipments to U.S. customers, which decreased company revenues for the period and increased administration expenses. The company did not rule out further technology disruptions that could have additional monetary effects on operations.

The irreverent IT Web site, The Register, broke the story shortly after Levi Strauss filed its quarterly report, and Michael Krigsman followed it up in his IT Project Failures blog on ZDNet.

The Levi Strauss scenario was a classic case involving what Krigsman called ""Devil's triangle relationships"" where responsibility can fall between the software vendor, the customer, and a third-party implementation consultant - in this case Deloitte.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,ERP"
2008-07-01T07:00:00Z,"Cut Optus Fibre Optic Cable Affect 1 Million Customers in Queensland, Australia"," Cut causes major land line, mobile phone and internet shutdown for over four hours ",,,4,hours,4,1000000,,,,Australia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/fun_in_the_land_of_oz,,Fiber Optics Fun In the Land of Oz,"Last week, a fiber optic cable was severed causing a major land line, mobile phone and internet shutdown for more than one million people in Queensland and Northern NSW. Automatic teller machines and Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) services were also affected. Needless to say, people were not amused.

According to various news reports, the telecommunications company Optus's system went down at 0753 (AEST) when a backhoe operator severed its fiber optic cable. Service was restored about four hours later, but not before major problems appeared, such as at Brisbane Airport where domestic and international flights were delayed as everything reverted to manual mode.

A back-up system was activated through an inland network, but because of a system card failure the night before, the back-up system wasn't available.

Optus called the outage a ""one in a million"" event. What's more, Optus said it believed the problem could not have been averted.

""We can't design a network or build a network on those one in a million chances,"" an Optus spokesperson said.

What made the story more ""entertaining"" - at least to those observers from afar - was the ""who was to blame for the cut"" game that immediately began playing out. The outage was estimated to cost customers millions of dollars, many of whom may be eligible for compensation from someone. The trick is determining who that someone is.

The Gold Coast City Council initially denied it was involved and blamed the Queensland State Government for the incident. It later had to admit that the fiber optic cable was indeed severed on a council's ""pumps and pipes"" project that was not yet officially part of the huge Queensland $9 billion water grid project.

However, the City Council then added that checks failed to reveal the location of the cable before it was severed by the backhoe operator. It implied that the telco Optus was at fault, not them.

This pass the blame gambit got Optus angry. It soon released photos showing the cable cut was about 2 meters from a large white warning sign that indicated one of its cables was in the area.

The City Council still maintained, even after the photos were published, that they had done all the proper checks and the cable wasn't where it was expected to be.

A report is scheduled to be released later this week with more details about what happened and why, and who likely will end up getting stuck paying compensation.","Australia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected"

As a result, hundreds of flight across the country were delayed. The US East Coast was hardest hit, but the ripple effects were felt throughout the US with over three dozen airports experiencing delays.

To cope with the problem, the FAA shifted the load to its other flight plan processing center in Salt Lake City, Utah which can handle the load of approving flight plans, but at a much slower rate. The added airline flight plans had to be entered into computers manually and then processed by the system there in Salt Lake City, the FAA said. Instead of taking a few seconds, the process takes a few minutes.

However, at one point, airlines were told not to file any flight plans because things were getting so backed up.

The situation immediately became a US election issue, with both Senators John McCain and Barack Obama saying that the long-broken air traffic control system needed to be fixed.

This is the second problem at the Hampton FAA facility within the last week. A hardware problem six days ago delayed the departures of at least 134 flights.

Reuters quoted an LSE spokesperson as saying:

""It was software-related, a coincidence, due to two processes we couldn't have foreseen. We've introduced a fix and we're confident it will not happen again.""

Hmm, the LSE may be confident that that particular software fault may not occur again, but it does sow some level of doubt that their are many others that are also ""unforeseen"" lurking about.

The LSE is now conducting an investigation into the shut-down, and I will be curious to see just how ""unforeseen"" the software fault actually was.

The shutdown happened just about at the worst possible moment, from the LSE's perspective. Given the US government takeover of the mortgage companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae over the weekend, trading volume was expected to be very heavy on the exchange. Some reports claim that UK trading firms lost nearly $1.5 million dollars apiece as a result of the shutdown.

Second, the shutdown damaged the LSE's reputation as a reliable exchange to trade in. As the second largest exchange in the world, any problem not only affects a multitude of traders but creates uncertainty and doubts about their trades going though properly, which traders hate.

Third, the LSE has been promising to deliver both faster and more reliable service in order to remain competitive with the New York Stock Exchange. As I noted, just last week it created a way to complete sub-millisecond trades. For such an outage to occur on such an important day, and only a few days after touting its new capabilities, makes any future LSE promises ring a bit hollow.","UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,stock exchanges"

LOS ANGELES The train driver blamed for the worst U.S. train crash in 15 years was sending and receiving text messages seconds before his crowded commuter train skipped a red light and collided head-on with a freight train, federal investigators said on Wednesday.

The Metrolink commuter train plowed into a Union Pacific freight locomotive on September 12 in Chatsworth, California, killing 25 people and injuring 135 in the worst train accident since 1993.

A National Transportation Safety Board probe has focused on whether the engineer, identified as Robert Martin Sanchez, 46, failed to heed trackside signals. Sanchez was killed in the crash.

Cell phone records show Sanchez was sent a text message at 4:22:01 p.m., and received one at 4:21:03 p.m. The accident occurred at 4:22:23 p.m., according to Union Pacific train's onboard recorders.

He received seven and sent five text messages between 3:00 p.m. and the time of the accident.

Sanchez also received 21 text messages and sent 24 while he ran a train from 6:44 a.m. to 8:53 a.m.

Since the timings were not all recorded on a common platform, the precise correlation between the events is not clear, investigators at the NTSB said.

Local TV station KCBS reported that a teenager claimed to have received a text message from the Metrolink engineer a minute before the collision.

Following the accident, California authorities temporarily banned railroad workers from using cellphones on duty.

Some 70 plus passengers and crew were injured, 14 severely.

Speculation for the cause ranged from air turbulence to possibly a passenger's wireless laptop computer interfering with the aircraft's avionics. Both of those have been ruled out.

The Australian paper Sydney Morning Herald reported that investigators found during the analysis of flight data that the plane's air data inertial reference unit - the device responsible for supplying data on air pressure, temperature and acceleration - had failed.

The failure caused incorrect wrong data to be sent to the aircraft's flight control system.

Australian Transport Safety Bureau's director of aviation safety investigation, Julian Walsh said that, ""Because of the fault â'¿ [the component] has indicated to the flight control computer that the angle of attack of the aircraft was higher.""

""So the flight computer has considered that it needed to nose the aircraft over.""

""About two minutes later â'¿ the flight control computers commanded a nose-down movement,"" Mr Walsh said. ""The inertial reference unit continued to generate random spikes and a second nose-down aircraft movement was encountered.""

The component that malfunctioned is used on A330-300s, A330-200s, A340s and non-Airbus aircraft.

A preliminary report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is scheduled to be out one month from the date of the flight. This is the latest information from the bureau on the incident.","Australia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - injured or killed,airplane"

According to a story by the Associated Press, ""Congress passed a law in 1996 [the Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1996 (PL 104-275)] giving veterans' spouses the right to keep their partners' final month of benefits. It instructed the VA to make changes as needed to comply with the law, which took effect for spouses of veterans who died after Dec. 31, 1996.""

However, according to the story, the VA never updated its computer systems to meet the requirements of the law. As a result, ""widows were either denied the final month of payment or asked to send the checks back. In many cases, if the checks already were deposited or spent, the U.S. Treasury moved to seize the money directly from the widow's account.""

Initial estimates are that 400,000 widows might be affected, some of whom are owed up to $2,500. I wonder if the VA will make pay interest on any money US Treasury illegally took back.

The VA promises to correct the situation sometime after February 2009, although the question has to asked, how did situation this exist for so long? I know that the VA computer systems have been audited by third parties as well as internal VA groups several times in the past decade. I think the VA inspector general needs to go back and ask some hard question about the thoroughness of these IT audits to verify the VA's IT systems compliance with applicable laws.","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit"

""This resulted in complications with data synchronization between the primary and redundant data feed generators, which impacted the delivery of the Level 1 data feeds. Because not all investors could access information about trading on the market, the decision was made to halt trading,"" TSX said.

Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange opened for trading as normal at 0930 yesterday morning. However at 0937, there was a problem with the Level 1 data feeds, which made trading data unavailable to some members of the trading community. At 0948, trading was halted by TSX on both exchanges to protect market integrity. During the 18 minute session, approximately 28,000 trades occurred.

The EDS led ATLAS consortium won a contract in March 2005 to design, install and run the project.

MoD intends to have some 150,000 terminals supporting 300,000 users at more than 2,000 sites, with additional capability on deployed operations and Royal Navy ships. DII must be able to handle material classified as Restricted, Secret and Top Secret.

The program, if fully implemented, is estimated to cost will cost an estimated Â£7.1 billion by 2015. The original contract was for Â£4 billion.

The PAC reports, however, that, ""The implementation of DII has suffered from major delays. Whereas 62,800 terminals should have been installed by the end of July 2007, only 45,600 were in place at the end of September 2008. The main causes of delay were the Programmeâ''s over-optimistic assumptions about the condition of the buildings into which DII would be fitted, and the consequent selection of an inappropriate and unresponsive methodology for installing terminals.""

In addition, ""The DII Programme also provides a range of core software such as word processing, email, internet access and security to run on the new system. This should all have been available in June 2006, but less than half of the requirement had been delivered two years later in June 2008.""

The PAC reports says that the DII program is now 18 months late, and the problems encountered so far has caused the program costs to increase another estimated Â£182 million. The MoD has already spent Â£334 million of the Â£528 million risk funding with which it was provided even though the program is not close to being half done, PAC claims.

The DII program has been controversial from the beginning, not so much for its objectives, but for MoD awarding the contract to EDS. At the time EDS - now part of HP - had major IT program problems at the Inland Revenue (now HM Revenue and Customs) and the Department of Work and Pensions (in fact, settlement over the problems at Inland Revenue where it got fired were just resolved).

EDS was also having trouble delivering on its multi-billion US Navy Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) contract, which was one of the references that the ATLAS consortium undoubtedly used to claim that it (now) knew how to manage and implement a program like DII correctly.

When the contract was awarded in 2005, an MoD spokesman reportedly said that due diligence had been done at the EDS-led ATLAS team reference sites at home and overseas and the department was confident past mistakes wouldn't be repeated.

The Miami-Dade School Board voted unanimously on Jan. 14 to fire Deloitte Consulting, the firm it hired to oversee the installation of new technology to deal with payroll, employees, and finance systems, reports the Miami Herald. The district will now adopt its own plan to keep the $85.4 million project going. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho stressed that the change would not cost the district any additional money. ‘This allows us to contain the cost, assure control of the timeline, and guarantee the pace,’ Carvalho told the Herald. ‘Now, we can be reasonably confident that we can see the project through to completion.’ The project, called Business Operating Solutions for Schools, or BOSS, will streamline the district’s payroll, human resources, and finance systems. So far, the district has invested about $52 million into the project. But a recent audit showed that BOSS was about three months behind schedule and over budget. In addition, auditors said it was riddled with staffing and management problems. Schools Chief Financial Officer Richard Hinds said that the two-year timeline Deloitte set was unrealistic. Both Deloitte and the software itself have had problems in other districts. Last year, the software left thousands of Los Angeles teachers without paychecks; resolving the glitch cost about $40 million…

In its brochures, Deloitte Consulting proclaims a record of “smooth implementations” of complex technology projects. But in courts, school systems, and government agencies in several states, the roll-out of computer systems built by the global consulting firm has proved to be anything but smooth.

From Florida and Pennsylvania to California, multimillion-dollar projects managed by the New York company have come in behind schedule, over budget, and riddled with problems. It is a situation that has been repeated in Massachusetts this summer; Deloitte was two years late and $6 million over budget in delivering a system to manage unemployment claims, and, separately, the Department of Revenue fired the firm for falling behind on a $114 million tax-system overhaul mired in errors.

In Florida’s Miami-Dade County, school officials fired Deloitte in 2009, partway through an $84 million contract to overhaul the district’s computer system. After paying Deloitte $30 million and having “virtually nothing” usable they could rescue, Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said, the district turned the project over to its in-house technology department, which completed it on time and within the budget.

“After much review the best thing to do was terminate Deloitte, and we did with a vengeance,” Carvalho said. “We cut out the middleman.”

In a statement, Deloitte defended its efforts on public contracts, saying it has worked with agencies in 45 states.

“Thousands of these projects have been delivered without incident and we acknowledge the challenges we’ve had with certain engagements,’’ Dan Prince, a Deloitte spokesman, said. “That said, we’re proud of what we’ve done in this segment and would not want these few projects to be held up as reflective of our entire body of work.’’

The problems with several of Deloitte’s systems also spotlight the difficulties that state and local governments often have in managing large technology projects, contracting specialists said. Few agencies have the will to end a project that is going badly, often fearing they will not find another firm to take over the job.

In Massachusetts, for instance, state labor officials agreed to pay Deloitte an extra $4 million to keep working after the firm missed its first deadline to deliver the system in 2011.

Eric Kimberling, a consultant who has testified in disputes over large technology contracts, said such projects are frequently riddled with problems because public officials underestimate what it takes to complete them and consultants “lowball the cost to get their foot in the door.”

Many government agencies have to get halfway through a contract before “they know what it’s really going to take to get a project done right,” said Kimberling, managing partner of Panorama Consulting Solutions of Denver.

A project for California’s massive court system shows how bad it can get.

Officials hired Deloitte and another firm in 2003 to create a statewide case management system, connecting 58 county courts, as well as appellate courts. By 2010, Deloitte was running the entire job, and the contract had been amended 102 times, ballooning in cost to $310 million from $33 million, according to a state audit.

Worse, the cost to install the software had been wildly underestimated. The total price tag soared to a projected $1.9 billion, so expensive that the courts could not afford to put the system into operation.

“We basically got this nice SUV that can really do everything but we can’t afford to get it out on the road,’’ said Cathal Conneely, spokesman for California’s Administrative Office of the Courts.

The state audit blamed the court system for agreeing to contract terms that failed to ensure it had sufficient oversight of Deloitte.

Howard Anderson, a senior lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, said states rarely have IT teams that are equipped to oversee big projects, in part because people with technical talent can earn far more working for private companies. In addition, states rarely have the resources of a global giant like Deloitte, with about 61,000 US employees.

“Essentially, they are outmanned and outgunned,’’ Anderson said. “The state needs help, and they can’t afford to have that help internally.’’

That is one of the reasons that firms like Deloitte successfully court state governments and win vast amounts of business, IT contracting specialists said. In Massachusetts, the state has paid Deloitte Consulting at least $130 million for taxpayer-funded projects since 2010, according to the state’s Open Checkbook site, which tracks contracts.

In Los Angeles, school officials watched the cost of one Deloitte system jump 35 percent above its original price. The payroll system, which eventually cost $132 million, was plagued by hardware and software breakdowns that underpaid or overpaid teachers and school employees by tens of millions of dollars, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The city had to establish emergency hot lines, which were overwhelmed by calls. The school district sued, and in 2008 reached a settlement that required Deloitte to pay $8.3 million and forgive $7 million to $10 million in unpaid invoices. School officials declined to discuss the project or specifics of the Deloitte lawsuit.

David Tokofsky, a former school board member who favored hiring Deloitte but was later critical of the firm’s performance, said the final product did not justify the cost.

“The moral is, if your car is 14 years old with 160,000 miles on it and is not falling apart, don’t go and get a new car,’’ Tokofsky said.

In 2009, Pennsylvania’s auditor general performed an examination entirely dedicated to Deloitte’s broad reach with the state, including 25 contracts. The 179-page report detailed problems with procurement and management of contracts at agencies ranging from welfare to the state liquor board. The liquor board, for example, awarded Deloitte a $26 million contract to upgrade the agency’s technology, but the system caused inventory shortages while the cost more than doubled, to $60 million.

The auditor’s review pointed back to state officials for better oversight, saying it “found numerous concerns, including poor accountability of contracts totaling $592.1 million.’’

2009-02-01T07:00:00Z,US Begins Transitions to HDTV,,,,,,,,,,,US,,Government,National,Commerce and Communications,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/dtv,true,Special Report: DTV,"Special Report: DTV

Special Report: THE DAY ANALOG TV DIES

The United States’ National Television System Committee (NTSC) analog television standard dates back to 1941. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) upgraded it to incorporate color in 1953, and for the past half century, this standard has ruled the U.S. airways, enabling viewers to tune in to free over-the-air television, whether their TVs were built this year or inherited from a grandparent. But on 17 February 2009, NTSC broadcasts will end forever, replaced by the ATSC digital standard.

It took an act of Congress to make this switch from analog to digital—or rather several. The U.S. Congress established the Advanced Television Systems Committee, for which ATSC is named, in 1982. The FCC adopted the standard in 1996, and Congress assigned each television broadcaster a second piece of radio spectrum on which to simulcast digital programming along with analog, intending that extra real estate as a loan, to be returned when the vast majority of TV viewers in the country had begun relying on digital signals. Congress tried to call the loan in 2006, but it had set certain thresholds for digital penetration that had not been met. So Congress reset the date to 2009, picking mid-February as the perfect window between two major TV events—the Super Bowl and the NCAA “March Madness” basketball tournament.

IEEE Spectrum has been following the development of ATSC, the technology behind it, and its rollout for two decades. Now we’re tracking this final transition to an all-digital broadcast world, a transition that may not go as smoothly as Congress, the FCC, the broadcasters, the consumer electronics manufacturers, or the average viewer might hope. Follow the links below to review the technology and its history, and track what’s happening with the transition today (we’ll be updating these links regularly) as Spectrum counts down to the day analog TV dies. —Tekla S.

The aircraft sustained substantial damage as well as damaged some airport lighting and the airport's instrument landing system. The aircraft immediately returned to the airport for an emergency landing which it did without incident (although the landing was described as ""hard"").

As described by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau preliminary safety report released this week:

""At 2231:53, the captain called for the first officer to rotate. The first officer attempted to rotate the aircraft, but it did not respond immediately with a nose-up pitch. The captain again called 'rotate' and the first officer applied a greater nose-up command. The nose of the aircraft was raised and the tail made contact with the runway surface, but the aircraft did not begin to climb. The captain then selected TOGA on the thrust levers, the engines responded immediately, and the aircraft commenced a climb.""

""The crew notified air traffic control of the tail strike and that they would be returning to Melbourne. While reviewing the aircraft's performance documentation in preparation for landing, the crew noticed that a take-off weight, which was 100 tonnes below the actual take-off weight of the aircraft, had inadvertently been used when completing the take-off performance calculation. The result of that incorrect take-off weight was to produce a thrust setting and take-off reference speeds that were lower than those required for the actual aircraft weight.""

Apparently, ""a crew member entered an incorrect figure into the electronic flight bag, a laptop computer which provides data to the aircraft's electronic flight control system."" Instead of entering the true weight of 362 tonnes on the laptop, the aircraft weight actually entered was 262 tonnes.

The two aircraft pilots resigned/were fired from the airline. The airline also says that it has ""added an extra step â'' and an additional computer â'' to its performance calculations to ensure they were executed properly.""

2009-05-01T07:00:00Z,KFC Online Promotion Backfires, Online promotion creates more demand than can be handled by restaurants ,,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/how_not_to_do_an_online_promot,true,How Not To Do An Online Promotion,"In early February, Denny's Restaurant, a chain which is best known for its breakfasts (and customer discrimination lawsuits in the late 1990s), offered its ""Grand Slam Breakfast"" (pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage) for free across the US as a promotion to generate new business. It was a spectacular marketing success.

Not surprisingly, other restaurant chains have been thinking about following suit.

Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) this week decided to try a nation-wide promotion similar in nature to Denny's. In hopes of sparking nationwide interest in its new grilled-chicken offering, KFC teamed up with The Oprah Winfrey Show to offer a free two-piece grilled chicken dinner with two individual side items and a biscuit. All one needed to do was go to the KFC or Oprah website and download a coupon

Be careful what you wish for, as my mother (and yours probably) once told me.

Not only was the KFC/Oprah promotion sites overwhelmed by people seeking coupons, but KFC outlets were also overwhelmed by customers demanding their free meal. While many outlets honored the coupon, many other KFC outlets - which are owned by individual franchisees who don't necessarily have to follow corporate-sponsored promotions terms and conditions - refused to honor them; a few even reportedly closed up shop altogether.

Instead of a marketing success, KFC s promotion is now being seen as a huge PR blunder, one that has successfully created some very disgruntled customers. Different websites have posted hundreds of angry comments about KFC.

KFC in response has posted a video message from the company's president saying:

""We are so sorry, but due to the overwhelming response to our FREE Kentucky Grilled Chickenâ'¢ meal coupon, we can no longer redeem the free coupon at this time. But we will honor our commitment to giving you a free Kentucky Grilled Chicken meal.""

""Please visit a participating KFC restaurant for a rain check form. Complete the form, attach your original coupon, and give it to the KFC restaurant manager or postmark per the formâ''s instructions, by May 19, 2009, and weâ''ll send you a rain check for your free Kentucky Grilled Chicken meal at a later date, plus a free Pepsi with our compliments. Your participating KFC restaurant will provide you with the form you need.""

""Please note that the redemption periods of the rain checks will vary. All other terms and conditions of the original free Kentucky Grilled Chicken coupon will apply.""

KFC outlets better have enough rain check forms, or KFCs promotion will turn from a mere blunder into a PR nightmare. KFC franchise owners (many of which claimed to be caught unawares by the promotion) are also not going to be happy having their managers collect and send in all these forms.

Col. Sanders, a master of promotion, would no doubt be disappointed in his old company's marketing ineptitude. KFC has been using the tag line, ""Unthink what you thought about KFC"" to try to reintroduce the troubled brand as one that has healthy food - now the tag line, unfortunately, has taken on a whole new meaning.

I will be very interested in seeing how the next restaurant chain approaches an on-line national food promotion.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,,Impact - Raw"

The driver admitted to texting his girlfriend at the time.

MBTA General Manager Daniel Grabauskas said that the driver told him that ""he noticed, as he was looking down, the red lights and looked up, but it was too late as he applied the brake and the train struck the other trolley.""

As a result of the accident, the MBTA GM has, says the Boston Globe, banned ""on-the-job possession of cellphones by T operators and would fire anyone caught carrying a phone, pager, or similar device.""

The GM added, ""This is going to be a zero-tolerance policy.""

MBTA union officials are supporting the GM's decision.

Last year, the worst US train accident in 15 years happened in California and killed 25 people and injured 135 more. The crash was blamed on the train engineer text messaging. Federal Railroad Administration authorities in October 2008 issued ""emergency order explicitly prohibiting the use of personal electronic devices by railroad employees while operating trains and in other settings.""

In related news, the New York Times Bits blog is reporting that Verizon is going to support a New York state initiative to ban texting while driving. Verizon has in the past supported other state banning initiatives.

However, the blog post notes that Verizon is ""not, as of now, prepared"" to support a full cellphone ban while driving.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Transportation,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - injured or killed,mass transit"

According to the latest Nielsen Company research survey report of 7 June, 2.8 million American households (or 2.5% of the total) are still not ready for today's transition. Even so, articles like this one in the LA Times are predicting that the transition should be a big yawn.

As a matter of interest, I did a bit of digging about for the predictions of how many HDTV's would be sold by the transition. When the Digital TV Transition and Public Safety Act of 2005 was being debated by the US Congress, HDTV sales were predicted to jump to a market value of $65 billion by 2009. More interesting, almost half (47%) of US TV households surveyed supposedly were planning to buy an HDTV in 2006.

However, according to Nielsen again, only one out of three TV households currently own a HDTV set. I don't have the latest estimated 2009 HDTV market value (does anyone else have it?) but I doubt it has reached $65 billion.

The next big issue for the US DTV transition will be for those receiving their TV from the cable companies, who over the next few years will be forcing their customers to obtain new cable boxes if they want to use non-digital TV sets or even digital TV sets. That should prove to be increasingly interesting as those with cable have been repeatedly told that they had nothing to worry about in regard to the DTV transition.

That was the truth, but unfortunately, not the whole truth.","US,,Government,National,Commerce and Communications,,"

2009-06-01T07:00:00Z,Automated Train Control Failure Involved in Washington DC Metro Crash," 9 killed, 52 injured in crash ",,61,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Rail,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/national-transportation-safety-board-issues-urgent-dc-metro-safety-recommendation,,National Transportation Safety Board Issues Urgent DC Metro Safety Recommendation,"Yesterday, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued two urgent safety recommendations in the aftermath of the fatal Washington DC Metro train collision last month.

The first recommendation was to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) in which the NTSB called for WMATA to improve its train control system to be able to:

""evaluate track occupancy data on a real-time basis in order to detect losses in track occupancy and automatically generate alerts to prompt such actions as immediately stopping train movements or implementing appropriate speed restrictions to prevent collisions.""

In a somewhat worrying story in today's Washington Post, DC Metro officials said that they had replaced every component in the track circuit suspected as being the cause of the accident, but the problem persists. As a result, Metro trains continue to be operated in manual mode instead of under computer control.

Metro officials also claim in the story that a safety system such as the one the NTSB is recommending does not presently exist, and would have to be ""invented.""

However, San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system which is very similar in design to the DC Metro system has such a system in place, the Post says, because it experienced a ""ghost train"" problem in the 1970s. The Post story also says that Metro officials claim that the BART system wouldn't work in DC, but did not offer any detail why not other than saying Metro was different than BART.

Metro officials ""thanked"" the NTSB for its recommendation, but also not too subtly suggested that the NTSB focus their efforts on helping them find out why the track circuit keeps failing. Given past history, it would not surprise me that Metro management is highly concerned about the cost of developing and rolling out a continuous train monitoring system, and is therefore hoping that the track circuit failure can be traced to something easier and less expensive to correct.

Metro's management hasn't, as far as I know, backed off its belief that the accident was a ""freak occurrence.""

The NTSB also made a second urgent recommendation to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) in which it urged the FTA:

""to advise all rail transit operators with train control systems capable of monitoring train movements to evaluate their systems for adequate safety redundancy.""

An overdue recommendation from my personal passenger perspective, which also left me asking just how many transit systems of the above type do not have redundant safety monitoring systems in place.

Anyone know?

As I mentioned here, major parts of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority subway system use the same computer control system as the Metro. I suspect that they will be looking closely at this second NTSB recommendation too.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Rail,,Impact - Raw,Impact - injured or killed"
2009-06-01T07:00:00Z,$200 Billion US Army Future Combat System Program Terminated, $18 Billion spent ,,,,,,,,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/us-army-future-combat-systems-program-formally-terminated,,US Army's Future Combat Systems Program Formally Terminated,"The US Department of Defense formally ended the US Army's Future Combat System (FCS) modernization effort yesterday. In a memorandum signed by theUnder Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Ashton Carter, the Army has now been directed:

""to transition to a modernization plan consisting of a number of separate but integrated acquisition programs ... Those integrated programs include one to spin out the initial increment of the FCS program to seven infantry brigades in the near term and additional programs for information and communications networks, unmanned ground and air vehicles and sensors, and an integration effort aimed at follow-on spinouts to all Army brigades.""

The FCS program started in 2003 with an Army estimated cost of $92 billion which then grew to an Army estimated $160 billion in 2006. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) and others had put the costs more at between $200 billion and $300 billion. To date, the Army has spent about $18 billion in FCS research and development, which it hopes to utilize in its new Army Brigade Combat Team Modernization effort.

There have also been on-going problems with developing the software needed to support the various FCS platforms. I wrote last year about the problems with the software development within FCS in the Risk Factor here and here. When first proposed, FCS was supposed to contain 33.7 million lines of code; by the end of 2007 it had grown to 63.8 million. This year the GAO said it had climbed again to 114 million.

Though the Army insisted from the beginning that the risk of the program was manageable, former chief of staff of the Army General Peter Schoomaker admitted after the contract was let in 2003 that the FCS program had only a 28 percent chance of success. Even optimistic estimates by Schoomaker never placed it above 70 percent.

Spiraling cost and problems with software aside, what finally did in FCS was Secretary of Defense Robert Gates'...

""specific concern that the portion of the FCS program to field new manned combat vehicles did not adequately reflect the lessons of counterinsurgency and close quarters combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was further troubled by the terms of the current single contract covering the whole FCS effort.""

Secretary Gates announced his desire to terminate the FCS program in April.

Hopefully, the Army will learn some hard lessons from this episode. from the beginning FCS was too complex and too expensive . However, given that as late as March of this year the Army leadership was insisting that the program was ""executed well,"" there is much room for doubt.

2009-06-01T07:00:00Z,Air France Flight 447 Crashes Off Coast of Brazil," 228 passengers and crew perished, Automation paradox at play ",,228,,,,228,,,,"Brazil, France",Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/aviation/air-france-flight-447-crash-caused-by-a-combination-of-factors,,Air France Flight 447 Crash Causes in Part Point to Automation Paradox,"A deadly combination of pilot confusion, “warning system ergonomics” design and inadequate pilot training were responsible for the crash of Air France Flight 447 on 1 June 2009.

This is the conclusion reached by the BEA (Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'aviation civile), the French authority responsible for carrying out safety investigations relating to accidents or serious incidents in civil aviation, in its final report into the crash. BEA’s 224-page report indicated that the aircraft might have been flown out of danger if the pilots had realized the situation they were facing.

The summary of the report (pdf) provides the following account, which begins with the “unleashing event” of the icing over of the three Pitot tubes that provide airspeed data to the Airbus 330-200’s flight computers and which subsequently caused the aircraft’s autopilot to disengage:

The blockage of the Pitot probes by ice crystals in cruise was a phenomenon that was known but misunderstood by the aviation community at the time of the accident. From an operational perspective, the resulting loss of all airspeed information was an identified malfunction. After initial reactions involving basic airmanship skills, it was supposed to be diagnosed by pilots, and managed if necessary by precautionary inputs on the pitch attitude and thrust detailed in the associated procedure. The occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise completely surprised the crew of flight AF 447. The apparent difficulties in handling the aeroplane in turbulence at high altitude resulted in over-handling in roll and a sharp nose-up input by the PF [pilot flying]. The destabilisation that resulted from the climbing flight path and changes in pitch attitude and vertical speed therefore added to the incorrect airspeed indications and ECAM [Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring] messages that did not help any diagnosis. The crew, whose work was becoming disrupted, likely never realised they were facing a «simple» loss of all three airspeed sources. In the first minute after the autopilot disconnection, the failure of the attempt to understand the situation and the disruption of crew cooperation had a multiplying effect, inducing total loss of cognitive control of the situation. The behavioural assumptions underlying the classification of a loss of airspeed information as «major» were not validated in the context of this accident. Confirmation of this classification therefore requires additional work in terms of operational feedback in order to modify, where necessary, crew training, the ergonomics of the information made available to them, as well as the design of procedures. The aeroplane went into a sustained stall, signalled by the stall warning and strong buffet [the warning at one point sounded continuously for 54 seconds but apparently was ignored]. Despite these persistent symptoms, the crew never understood they were in a stall situation and therefore never undertook any recovery manoeuvres. The combination of the warning system ergonomics, the conditions under which pilots are trained and exposed to stalls during their professional and recurrent training, did not result in reasonably reliable expected behaviour patterns.

In short, as BEA head Jean-Paul Troadec is quoted at the crash report news conference last Thursday at Le Bourget Airport in Paris:

“It seems that the pilots did not understand the situation and they were not aware that they had stalled.”

However, Troadec also made it very clear that BEA was not blaming the pilots alone for the accident:

“If the BEA thought that this accident was only down to the crew, we would not have made recommendations about the systems, the training, etc.”

He went on to say:

“What appears in the crew behavior is that most probably, a different crew should have done the same action. So, we cannot blame this crew. What we can say is that most probably this crew and most crews were not prepared to face such an event.”

In fact, BEA made a total of 25 recommendations (pdf) covering everything from better training of aircrews to changes in display logic to improvements in search and rescue. Training pilots to fly aircraft manually at high altitudes is seen as a major need.

Many of the recommendations also deal with the so-called “automation paradox,” i.e., which as I wrote about for IEEE Spectrum concerns the situation where “the more reliable the automation, the less the human operator may be able to contribute to that success. Consequently, operators are increasingly left out of the loop, at least until something unexpected happens. Then the operators need to get involved quickly and flawlessly.”

In the Air France Flight 447 case, the crash report stated that the occurrence of the failure in the context of flight in cruise ""completely surprised the pilots,” and thus being “startled,” they were never able to comprehend what the difficulty caused the autopilot to disengage.

Going back to the summary of the crash report (with my highlighting):

“At present, recognition of the stall warning, even when associated with buffet, assumes that the crew assigns a minimum degree of «legitimacy» to the alarm. This in turn assumes sufficient prior experience with stall conditions, at least some cognitive availability and understanding of the situation, as well as knowledge of the aeroplane (and its protection modes) and its flight physics. A review of pilot training did not provide convincing evidence that the associated skills had been correctly developed and maintained.” “More generally, the dual failure of the expected procedural responses shows the limits of the current safety model. When action by the crew is expected, it is always assumed that they will have the capacity to initially control the flight path and to rapidly diagnose and identify the correct entry in the dictionary of procedures. A crew may encounter an unexpected situation causing a momentary but profound loss of understanding. If, in such cases, the assumed capacity to initially control and then to diagnose is lost, the safety model is in «common failure mode». In this occurrence, the inability to initially control the flight path also made it impossible to understand the situation and find the appropriate solution.”

What the pilots seemed to need was something akin to the “digital parachute” I blogged about last year being developed by Rockwell Collins that will take control of the aircraft's flight management system and return the aircraft to level flight (if possible) when a pilot hits a ""panic button"" during an emergency situation.

A story in the New York Times states that, “The French news media reported late Wednesday that a judicial panel of experts advising a separate criminal inquiry into the crash had recommended that blame not be placed solely on the pilots, saying that Air France, Airbus and European safety regulators also shared responsibility.”

Supposedly tomorrow, both Air France and Airbus will find out whether they will be charged with manslaughter in regard to their roles leading up to the crash. No word on whether the safety regulators will face legal scrutiny.","Brazil, France,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - injured or killed,airplane"

Given that: (a) today is the start of the 4th of July holiday weekend in the US, (b) O'Hare is the second busiest airport in the world, and (c) United Airlines is O'Hare's largest tenant, things were a mess at the airport this morning to say the least.

As a result of the computer crash, United ticket agents had to try and check-in outbound passengers by hand (up to 1,000 people stood in check-in lines at one point).

Also, arrving United planes had to sit on the tarmac because United's terminal gates were occupied by delayed departing flights.

In addition, several United flights ended up having to be canceled (interestingly, they did not follow British Airways' example).

Knock-on effects are expected all day long.

Customs had to use its back-up systems from about noon CDT to 1640 CDT before the main system was back on-line.

What was interesting about the story were two items: one, it wasn't only Customs' computers at O'Hare that were affected, but reportedly the problem affected CBP computers at airports nationwide. Reading over the Tribune story, probably close to 1,000 passengers were affected at O'Hare alone - how many passengers were affected across all US international airports?

The second point was that the news was reported only in the Chicago Tribune that I can find, even as of today, a couple of days later. The CPB makes no mention of it on their web site that I can find, either.

The CBP computer problems at LAX two years ago, although larger and longer, was widely reported from the start, as was the United Airlines computer outage a few days earlier at O'Hare.

2009-07-01T07:00:00Z,Tennessee's $135 Million ERP System in Shambles," 40% of state employees said they disliked the system, while 58% said it was worse that the old system ",,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/tennessees-erp-project-mess,true,Tennessee's ERP Project Mess,"After several years of analysis, the State of Tennessee embarked in May of 2005 on developing a $135 million enterprise resource planning (ERP) system called Project Edison. The purpose of Edison, the state says, is to:

""... perform Tennessee government administrative business functions, such as financials and accounting, procurement, payroll, benefits, and personnel administration... Edison uses a common database that allows the system to share information between business functions within an agency, and across agencies statewide.""

Tennessee expected Edison to save the state significant amounts of money currently being spent on administrative processing, as well as:

""... fundamentally change the way that the State of Tennessee does business by adopting the best practices that the new technology makes possible.""

After three years of work, on October 1, 2008, Project Edison's Human Resources/Payroll modules went live. The project plan then called for the state to deploy the Financials and Procurement / Logistics functionality in three waves. The first and second waves were deployed on January 1, 2009 and April 4, 2009 respectively, with the third wave set for to go live on July 1, 2009.

However, the third wave has not gone live because of troubles with the previous modules that have been rolled out.

In March of this year, for example, there were news reports of state government employees complaining that they were going unpaid or being struck off the payroll altogether because of software problems with Edison. State Finance Commission officials, however, said that the problems being reported were exaggerated, and that the complaints obviously were being made by a small number of state workers who had failed to learn how to use the new system correctly.

However, the complaints sparked an inquiry by State Comptroller Justin Wilson.

In May, Comptroller Wilson released his review which reported wide-spread dissatisfaction with Project Edison. For example, some 40% of employees said they disliked the system, while 58% said it was worse that the old system. Comptroller Wilson said in his report that,

""The issues described to us by state employees, HR Directors, and Project Edison staff indicate that the HCM [Human Capital Management - ed.] component is troublesome, time-consuming, flawed, and is not meeting management’s goals. These problems clearly exceed what would be expected in a start-up.""

Comptroller Wilson also called for a freeze on Project Edison's final implementation phase until the current problems were fixed.

However, in response, the state's Finance Commissioner Dave Goetz, continued to downplay the complaints and Comptroller Wilson's report. He said the problems were related to training issues and, yes, the ""normal"" start-up problems of a new, major IT system. He also not too politely implied that the Comptroller didn't know what he was talking about.

Commissioner Goetz also strongly disagreed with an implementation freeze, and Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen, an ardent supporter of Project Edison, seemed to support Commissioner Goetz's position.

However, by the end of June, it was clear even to Commissioner Goetz that Comptroller Wilson was correct, and that state workers weren't exaggerating their problems with using Edison.

Commissioner Goetz admitted that there were more problems with Project Edison than he had thought, and that its final roll-out needed to be delayed from July to September/October. The Commissioner also reportedly admitted that Edison was rolled out prematurely last year.

According to Comptroller Wilson, it will now cost at least $1 million to fix the problems. Until then, Comptroller Wilson says,

""We have a very, very volatile situation here. I don't think it's really an understatement to say that our integrity of the state is at risk here.""

Gov.Bredesen also saw the light and reportedly said he would do 50 things differently if he could do Project Edison over again. The governor still insisted, however, that a major problem was training, which had been ""underestimated.""

Continuing to blame the problem on training is a rather lame excuse.

You see, according to the Edison Project web site, ""skimping on training"" was one of three major mistakes the state had uncovered during its ""lessons learned"" tour of other states' ERP implementations (Not bringing in enough staff to get the job done and envisioning the implementation only as an IT project were the other two big mistakes that the Project Edison management team had discovered).

Blaming the problems being encountered on a lack of training is a rather clear-cut case of risk mismanagement from my perspective.

It makes one wonder, too, what the other 49 mistakes the governor also believes were made and should have been avoided.

Well, at least Tennessee's experience will provide a wealth of lessons learned (at least 50?) for other states contemplating a major ERP implementation.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,,Impact - Raw,ERP"

Last week, after just two years, the Family and Social Services Administration of the state of Indiana is reportedly contemplating scrapping its 10-year, $1.16 billion contract with IBM and its partner Affiliated Computer Services Inc (ACS) to privatize the state's welfare system. Among the reasons given is the mishandling of welfare claims; before the contract, the rate was just 4.38%, now it is 18.2%.

Indiana officials have warned IBM that it has until September to make performance improvements, and IBM has said that it is working with the state to do so quickly.

In February of this year, the privatization roll-out was stopped because state welfare officials were not sure that the new system could handle the volume of claims involving eligibility for food stamps, Medicaid and other state benefits. Because of the current deep recession, nearly 20% of Indiana residents - some 1.2 million people - are currently receiving benefits.

According to another report, however, it may be difficult for Indiana to cancel the contract even if it wanted to do so. One reason is that over 1,500 state case workers were turned over to IBM and ACS in March of 2007 when it began the contract. So who would the state use to do the work?

State officials admit that they have no ""Plan B"" in place to run the welfare system if it has to cancel the contract, and is hoping that it won't need one. Indiana state officials might be wise to recall Ben Franklin's old maxim: ""He that lives upon hope will die fasting.""

If I were betting on the outcome, given the current situation and Indiana's lack of realistic leverage, I would wager that what happened between the state of Texas and IBM will be repeated here. As you may recall, Texas Gov. Rick Perry suspended the $863 million, seven-year outsourcing deal it had done with IBM (and its partners) late last year for awhile because of serious performance problems. Talk of canceling the contract was in the air.

However, IBM, after its public scolding by Texas officials, credited back $900,000 back to the state for work not performed properly, and received $6 million less than the contract allowed for missing performance targets.

Once IBM paid the financial penalties and made some performance improvements, the contract quietly continued on as before, since doing otherwise would cause Texas government major operational difficulties as well as cause major embarrassment to those state government officials, including the Governor, who approved the contract in the first place.

I expect the same outcome in Indiana after a lot of thrashing about.

I'll let you know what happens.","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,,Impact - Raw,Contract termination/cancellation"
2009-08-01T07:00:00Z,California Runaway Car Crash Highlights Toyota Sudden Acceleration Issue, Policeman and family killed in runaway Toyota Lexus caused by stuck floor mat ,,4,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/how-hard-should-it-be-to-stop-a-runaway-car,,How Hard Should It Be To Stop a Runaway Luxury Car?,"In Sunday's LA Times, there was a very interesting article investigating the question whether ""Toyota's ignition, transmission and braking systems may make it difficult for drivers to combat sudden or unintended accelerations and safely recover, regardless of their cause.""

The story comes in light of the recent Toyota recall of 3.8 million vehicles involving driver side floor mats that might, if improperly installed, come loose or are not of the right type, jam certain Toyota models' accelerator pedals into the full open position. As Toyota notes, ""A stuck open accelerator pedal may result in very high vehicle speeds and make it difficult to stop the vehicle, which could cause a crash, serious injury or death."" The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recall notice is here.

Toyota's recall followed a terrible car crash in California in late August that killed 19-year veteran California Highway Patrol Officer Mark Saylor, his wife, teenage daughter and brother-in-law. Their borrowed 2009 Lexus ES 350 was traveling at 120 mph at the time, and despite his best efforts, Officer Saylor couldn't stop or slow down the car. A floor mat becoming stuck in the car's accelerator pedal is suspected as being the cause.

The LA Times says that there have been five related fatal crashes in the U.S. over the last two years involving runaway Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Toyota has maintained that sudden acceleration or runaway car incidents involving its vehicles are primarily due to improperly installed floor mats.

Critics, on the other hand, contend that the problem goes beyond floor mats, and may involve fundamental design issues in certain Toyota models, especially its luxury models which have highly complex electronically controlled or assisted systems.

(I wrote an article on software in cars earlier this year for Spectrum here.)

For instance, the Lexus ES 350 driven by Officer Saylor has a push-button starter, which is activated by the combination of a wireless electronic fob carried by the driver and a button on the dashboard, the Times says. To turn the car off in an emergency situation once it is in motion, you have to hold the start button down for a full three seconds: repeated pushing of the button does not work. The user's manual tells a driver this, but as the LA Times points out, this information is given only after telling drivers: ""Caution, Do not touch the 'power' switch while driving.""

In addition, shifting a car into neutral to try to disengage the engine from the transmission isn't easy either in an emergency situation. The Times story says, ""the ES 350 is equipped with an automatic transmission that can mimic manual shifting, and its shift lever on the console has a series of gates and detents that allow a driver to select any of at least four forward gears. The arrangement of those gear selections could make it difficult to shift from a forward gear directly into neutral in a panic situation, Toyota spokesman Lyons acknowledged.""

Spokesman Lyon added, rather worryingly, that, ""You'd be surprised how many people around here [Toyota] don't know what the neutral position is for.""

I guess most people no longer drive a manual shift anymore.

As for hitting the brakes to slow a car down, another issue pops up, says the Times. ""The ES 350 and most other modern vehicles are equipped with power-assisted brakes, which operate by drawing vacuum power from the engine. But when an engine opens to full throttle [like in a runaway car situation], the vacuum drops, and after one or two pumps of the brake pedal, the power assist feature disappears.""

Tests indicate that a person would have to exert 225 pounds of pressure on a brake pedal to stop it - a mean feat for almost anyone, let alone a person trying to keep a car on the road while avoiding hitting anything as it is traveling at 176 feet per second.

Critics have been insisting for a decade, the LA Times reports, that Toyota and other auto manufacturers need to install a fail-safe mechanism in their highly computerized engine control systems that can quickly recognize and then stop sudden acceleration/runaway car events. One suggestion is for the car's engine to be turned off when a car's brakes are depressed while the accelerator is also being depressed (people who like to ride their brakes may not like this feature, though).

Even Toyota, which has long resisted such installing such a device, has acknowledged that it is now rethinking its position.

The LA Times story ends with a note that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an investigation into sudden acceleration events involving Toyota vehicles.

The NYSE told traders that ""four matching engines"" were affected and some customers did not receive acknowledgments for their orders. As a result, traders' orders that were pending were canceled.

I assume that this means the order-matching engines. A similar problem hit the NYSE on the 26th of June. Different IT-related problems hit the exchange in mid-June and in early-July of this year.

An unknown problem caused the benchmark FTSE 100 index to remain unchanged for 28 minutes on last Friday afternoon. Trading on the London Stock Exchange, however, was unaffected.The FTSE Group, which compiles the index, isn't sure why the problem occurred, however.

According to the original Fox News story, Umoja was supposed to cost $286 million. However, according to a UN draft project plan titled ""Draft Report of the Secretary-General on the Enterprise Resourcing Planning (ERP) Project (Umoja)"", it is now around $337 million.

Some of the costs outlined in the document include (quoting here a summary by PC World):

""- $76 million for '2,597 work months' of system build and implementation services. - $14 million for travel, which presumes 1,285 trips will be taken by 'ERP team members, subject-matter experts and corporate consultants' at an average air ticket cost of $6,000. Each trip will also get $202 for ""'erminal expenses' and $5,000 for 20 days worth of per diems, for a total cost of about $11,000 per trip. - $1.8 million for office furnishings to support 234 workers, including 80 core staff, 66 subject matter experts, eight consultants and 80 system integrators, or about $7,700 per person. - $6.7 million for office rental, based on an annual rate of $14,300 per person - $564,200 for long distance telephone calls, teleconferencing and videoconferencing - $18 million for hiring ""limited replacements"" for subject matter experts involved in the project - $16 million for software licenses and maintenance fees.""

The document also claims that benefits delivered by the system will be anywhere from $470 million to $770 million in value.

Those benefits, however, the UN planning document says, are conditioned on several things, including:

""- Full and adequate funding - Continued senior executive support, and - Known good practices are followed such as; early and effective communications to create a shared understanding by the entire organization of the change process and all the support staff, involvement of managers and staff to participate in and review the design, building and testing activities, strict quality assurance of all deliverables, timely provision of decisions by the UN project Steering Committee, transfer of technical and systems knowledge from project specialists to UN staff, and, most importantly effective and ongoing education and training in both the new system but also all the new processes and standards that are going to be required.""

The lack of the latter condition is blamed for the ERP problems in the US state of Tennessee.

The UN says that the final project details are being finalized and it would discuss the project in more detail after that.

I would like to see the report estimate the likelihood of each of those six conditions above being met, since some, if you read the report closely, already appear to be violated.","UN,Operational Failure,Other,,,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,ERP"
2009-09-01T07:00:00Z,"Wisconsin's Accountability, Consolidation and Efficiency IT Project  Major Fiasco", Project costs grow from $15 Million to at least $104 Million. ,,,,,,,1.5E7,$,,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/wisconsins-accountability-consolidation-and-efficiency-initiative-it-projects-overrun-a-bit,,"Wisconsin's Accountability, Consolidation, and Efficiency Initiative's IT Projects Overrun A Bit","The Governor of Wisconsin Jim Doyle began a program in March 2005 called the Accountability, Consolidation, and Efficiency (ACE) Initiative to significantly improve the administrative functions of the state's Department of Administration (DOA) by June 2009. The DOA, according to this state press release, facilitates various administrative functions for Wisconsin state agencies, including managing human resources, purchasing goods and services, supporting computers and networks, and selling surplus state property.

Claims were made that the ACE Initiative would save $200 million over the four-year life of the project, with a lot of the savings coming from improvement in the state's IT operations.

Last week, Wisconsin state auditors cast lots of doubt on the $200 million savings figure, with one of the main reasons being - you guessed it - problems with trying to improve IT.

For example, one of ACE's objectives was to consolidate the state's computer servers across Wisconsin's 20 state agencies. So far, the audit report states that, as of June 2009:

""consolidated server and network support functions in only 7 of the 20 state agencies for which consolidation had been planned, while consolidation efforts for the other 13 are in various stages of completion. The 13 agencies continue to be responsible for operating and maintaining their own servers. To compensate for the elimination of their server and network support positions, these agencies have hired contractors, temporarily borrowed staff from other state agencies, and reassigned server and network support tasks to their remaining staff.""

In addition, the planned server consolidation was only supposed to cost $12.8 million, but in fact it has cost the state $90.9 million so far, and, if completed as predicted next year as now planned, will cost a total of $110 million: some nine times over budget.

State agency email systems have been successfully consolidated, the auditors note, except that the final cost was $13.4 million - some five times higher than the originally estimated cost of $2.6 million.

A third element of the ACE Initiative's goal for improving IT operations was the creation of an Integrated Business Information System or IBIS, which was intended to replace much of the existing administrative software used by Wisconsin state agencies. The project was estimated in 2005 to cost $135 million, with a project savings of between $35.4 million to $90.9 million being realized over ten years.

In May 2006, the auditors say, the DOA executed a contract with Oracle to purchase PeopleSoft Enterprise Solution software for IBIS. However, in April 2008, work on IBIS was suspended by the state because Wisconsin's dire financial straits wouldn't allow state agencies to provide the IT personnel required to staff the project.

So far, some $9.1 million has been spent on the IBIS project, with the Wisconsin still being on the hook for another $4.2 million in lease/license payments.

Given the previous overruns of nine and five times over planned budget on much simpler IT projects, taxpayers in Wisconsin should probably heave a huge sigh of relief at the IBIS suspension. The auditors dryly note that before a decision is made to restart IBIS, that

""Based on the project’s cost, scope, and importance, continued legislative scrutiny of IBIS is warranted.""

According to this Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel story, state legislators twice passed requirements that Wisconsin's Governor Jim Doyle detail the savings or costs of the ACE Initiative, but he vetoed them both times.

Little wonder why.

The Governor may want to veto the initiative name of ACE too. Seems a tad inappropriate.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty"

2009-10-01T07:00:00Z,Virginia's $2 Billion Outsourcing Contract in Chaos, Numerous state IT operations fall over  ,,,140,hours,140,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/virginias-2-billion-outsourced-it-contract-in-shambles,,Virginia's $2 Billion Outsourced IT Contract in Shambles,"As I noted last year, some seven years ago, Virginia approved the centralization of information technology services for all state agencies after an audit determined that Virginia was wasting over $100 million annually on IT project cost overruns and on unsuccessful efforts to get the different state departments' heterogeneous and outdated IT systems to communicate with one another. The result was the creation in late 2003 of the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) to bring IT under control as well as modernize it across the state.

VITA signed a 10-year, $2 billion IT outsourcing contract with Northrop Grumman in 2005, which at the time Virginia's State Comptroller said carried ""significant risk,"" a statement the state's CIO did not contest. But hopes back then were high, so the risks were accepted and the contract let anyway.

Late last year the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission released an audit report that essentially said that the outsourcing contract's significant risks had turned into significant problems, and that there would be no savings to the state through the initial 10-year term of the state's $2 billion agreement with Northrop Grumman.

Those in charge of VITA said the situation was not nearly so bad as what the audit report portrayed, and that things would be getting better in 2009.

What a difference a year makes.

The latest Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission audit briefing report, which runs to 131 slides, says that the situation is not only just as bad as last year, but probably is now worse.

For instance, Virginia State Police in Newport News lost Internet access for 78 hours in May 2009; the Department of Motor Vehicles in Bland lost network connection for 31 hours in June 2009; and Department of Environmental Quality in Roanoke lost network connection for 31 hours in May 2009. And then there was this little issue of Virginia's Prescription Monitoring Program web site being hacked and its data being held for ransom.

Furthermore, there is little the state can do about it all since terminating the contract would cost in the range of $400 million and leave IT operations in the state in absolute chaos.

The audit makes clear that the outsourcing contract was flawed from the beginning. and from my reading of it, the audit could be used as an excellent template on how not to design an IT outsourcing contract as well as how not to select a contractor for it.

As an example, one finding in the audit report was that while everyone knew the contract carried significant risk and that the Grumman proposal even said that ""it is natural for people to resist change"" and therefore a ""formal risk management and mitigation process is essential,"" an outside evaluation of risk management on the contract found it to be ""poor.""

No doubt risk mismanagement is also a reason that even though a large number of IT projects had their project schedules contractually relaxed, the revised project deadlines on the majority of them were still missed.

There are stories (here and here) in today's Washington Post and the Richmond Times Dispatch, which provide a good overview of the audit's findings.

Northrop Grumman says it doesn't agree with the audit report's findings, and says the state is much at fault for the on-going problems as it is.

Needless to say, that has gone over like a lead balloon with state officials, especially since the head of VITA said, ""I believe the [audit report] briefing accurately captures the history, progress and challenges of the modernization of Virginia’s IT infrastructure.""

The bottom-line is that Virginia will likely have to gut it out through 2015, and hope things improve at not too much extra cost. The state's only leverage is to hold Northrop Grumman's ""reputational feet"" to the fire to try to improve the situation, since the audit report also makes it very clear that for many contracted IT projects, Grumman gets paid in full whether it is late or not.

If the Virginia officials are smart, they will start now on defining the follow-on outsourcing contract, and try to have it completely vetted before 2015.

The same advice is true for Texas, Indiana and Wisconsin, who also have IT outsourcing problems of their own.

Perhaps all four states should get together to define what a realistic and risk-appropriate IT outsourcing contract looks like.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,,Impact - Raw"
2009-10-01T07:00:00Z,"Indiana Cancels $1.3 Billion Welfare Contract with IBM, Lawsuit Looms", Governor says IBM did not improve its performance ,,,,,,,,,,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/indiana-follows-through-with-threat-cancels-13-billion-outsourcing-contract,true,Indiana Follows Through with Threat: Cancels $1.3 billion Outsourcing Contract,"In July, I wrote about the State of Indiana reportedly contemplating scrapping its 10-year, $1.34 billion contract with IBM and its partner Affiliated Computer Services Inc (ACS) to privatize the state's welfare system. Among the reasons given was IBM's alleged mishandling of welfare claims; before the contract, the rate was just 4.38% but it had climbed to a then 18.2%.

Indiana officials warned IBM that it had until September to make performance improvements, and IBM said that it was working with the state to do so quickly.

Well, last weekend, time ran out: Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels terminated the state's contract with IBM.

The Governor's press release said in part that,

""The contract was canceled because the company did not make satisfactory progress to improve services to welfare applicants and recipients under a plan to correct deficiencies.""

In its place, the press release went on to say, will be ""a hybrid system that will incorporate successful elements of the old welfare delivery system and what is known as the modernized system. The hybrid system will include more face-to-face contact and more localized team-based case management.""

The new hybrid system will be run by Indiana's Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) which has until the 14th of December to develop a detailed go-forward plan.

Whether the FSSA will do a better job than IBM remains to be seen, especially with critics of the original outsourcing contract already saying such an approach will be inadequate.

IBM, which has been paid about $341 million so far on the contract and will be paid for another 60 days or so, protested that the cancellation was ""unjustified"" and may fight it (or at least try to get some severance package).

An IBM spokesperson said, ""IBM rejects the state's claims and believes the state's actions are unjustified. IBM will take action as appropriate to protect its rights under its contract with FSSA.""

Indiana's contract with IBM says ""the state may terminate this agreement, in whole or in part, for cause""; the argument will be whether there a legal cause existed.

IBM's partner, ACS, wasn't affected as of yet, mostly because IBM was a bigger target. But it looks like ACS will now get its turn in the barrel.

One Indiana state legislator was quoted as saying, ""We're going to be watching closely on ACS, because there is a perception that they are just as bad an actor as IBM.""

Toyota announced several elements to its ""remedy.""

First: ""The shape of the accelerator pedal will be reconfigured to address the risk of floor mat entrapment, even when an older-design all-weather floor mat or other inappropriate floor mat is improperly attached, or is placed on top of another floor mat. For the ES350, Camry, and Avalon models involved, the shape of the floor surface underneath will also be reconfigured to increase the space between the accelerator pedal and the floor.""

Second: ""Vehicles with any genuine Toyota or Lexus accessory all-weather floor mat will be provided with newly-designed replacement driver- and front passenger-side all-weather floor mats.""

Third: ""Toyota will install a brake override system onto the involved Camry, Avalon, and Lexus ES 350, IS350 and IS 250 models as an extra measure of confidence. This system cuts engine power in case of simultaneous application of both the accelerator and brake pedals.""

Toyota has long resisted a brake override system, so it is good to see it change its minds on this issue. Crashes such as that involving Officer Mark Saylor and his family might have been avoided.

Toyota went on to say that the brake override system will be made standard equipment throughout the Toyota and Lexus product lines starting with January 2010 production of the ES350 and Camry models and is scheduled to be incorporated into new production of most models by the end of 2010.

Toyota plans to have dealers ready to implement the changes by the beginning of 2010, at which point Toyota will begin notifying its customers to bring in their cars to receive the ""remedy.""

According to this story in the Washington Post, Toyota is ""very, very confident that we have addressed this issue.""

The initial estimated cost to Toyota of the recall is around $250 million.

After the recall is complete, it will be interesting to see whether there are still cases of runaway Toyota vehicles, which some still insist are caused by a fundamental problem in the electronic engine control systems of Toyota vehicles (and which Toyota strongly denies). If so, Toyota's reputation for quality and safety will take a huge drubbing.

The LA Times says that, ""State Employment Development Department officials say they are doing everything they can to issue the checks, even postponing some staff furloughs to deal with the demand for services. But they say the state's 30-year-old computer system isn't programmed to recognize the extensions, requiring technicians to write new code.""

California is hoping to start issuing the checks next week, although this may be optimistic.

California's Employment Development Department admits that it is rushing to reprogram its computers which usually means an unexpected problem is likely to crop up.

""We're trying to fully upgrade the system as it's moving at a record pace, while being very careful to not risk shutting down the rest of the system,"" an Employment Development Department spokesperson was quoted as saying in the Times' article.

I have noted previously over this year (e.g., here, here and here) some of the on-going problems other states have been having with their unemployment insurance systems. There is an excellent updated overview of these problems across the US here at CivSource.

And in a related development, the US Department of Agriculture is warning states not to outsource their food stamp programs, and article in the Statesman reports.

The USDA sent a letter out to state governments on the 20th of November which stated, ""These projects encountered severe problems in meeting critical performance standards and many eligible (food stamp) applicants have suffered as a result... We do not support furtherance of such projects, and believe that they put public funds and our clientele at risk.""

This places the states in a very uncomfortable quandary. Their IT systems are aging and fragile, and pose major operational risk. But the states are also being told by the Federal government that outsourcing their IT operations isn't recommended either because that poses unacceptable risk as well.

Australia awarded a AU$500 million contract for development of a smartcard ticketing system for public transport to the Keane Australia Micropayment Consortium (Kamco), with a planned go live (public trials) date of 1 March 2007. The system's design was to permit passengers to use a single plastic Myki smartcard to travel on a network that spans 270 railway stations, 480 trams and 1,650 buses. Passengers would be able to store value on their cards via self-service machines, the telephone or the Internet.

By December of 2007, however, the Myki project was already 9 months late, and over-budget by some AU$500 million. The plan then was for the ticketing system to become operational by June 2008.

Well, according to The Age, late last month, the Victorian government decided to rush the now AU$1.3 billion project into operation in order to meet a political promise to have Myki operating in Melbourne by the end of 2009. However, the government announced that Myki would only be working for the train system - not for trams or buses. Those would have to wait until later this year.

Since it's launch a week ago, there have been major operational problems that have caused the government much embarrassment.

For instance, some 1700 commuters received the wrong Myki smartcard, getting ones they did not order or receiving cards that couldn't be activated. There have also been problems with commuters being charges incorrect fares, or not being able to pass through entrance or exit gates because the cards wouldn't work properly. Things have gotten so bad that the distribution of Myki cards was temporarily halted.

The Acting Premier Rob Hulls called in the Transport Ticketing Authority executives responsible for Myki for a dressing down, telling them that the system's problems were ""unacceptable.""

I doubt that this chewing out will have much affect on the Authority or Kamco, however.

When asked, Kamco refused last week to apologize for the Myki project being so late and over-budget. Instead a Kamco spokesperson was quoted in The Australian as saying, ""We are rapt that it's out there... No, we aren't going to apologise for anything.""

Rapt?

Well, one definition of rapt is ""to be transported with emotion,"" which sort of describes the feelings of James Rowan and Dean Fidock, who headed South Australia's State Transport Authority when Adelaide's Metroticket system was introduced in 1987. According to another story in The Australian, the two said they were ""stunned at the amount of money wasted in the Myki fiasco.""

Adelaide's was the world's first electronic ticketing system and, like what Myki is supposed to eventually do, covers buses, trains and trams. However, the Adelaide ticketing system only cost AU$10.5 million to develop.

Even accounting for inflation since the mid-1980s, AU$1.3 billion does seem a wee bit excessive for a ticketing system in comparison.","Australia,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Transportation,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,mass transit"

One Risk Factor reader noted that Germany likely experienced the greatest date-related problem because software in a security microchip used in 30 million German bank cards was unable to recognize the date 2010.

As a result, bank card holders weren't able to use their cash cards or credit cards at automated teller machines and point-of-sale terminals from the 1st until the 8th of January 2010.

The German banks whose cards were affected have been trying to reprogram them on-the-fly whenever their customers attempt to use their cards again, say at an ATM machine. However, there are still reports that while the software fix seems to be working for the cards when they are used in Germany, the fix doesn't guarantee that the cards will work outside the country.

The Wall Street Journal reported that at least one bank, Commerzbank AG, has decided to replace any customer's card that won't work outside of Germany.

According to this story in DW-World.de, ""The blame for the card malfunctions has been placed on the French manufacturer of the cards, Gemalto. In Paris, the CGT trade union said the company had overworked the staff at its factory in Filderstadt, Germany. It also claimed that staff at a software development center near Marseilles had also been told to cut costs.""

There is no word on how long it will be before all the cards are fixed or replaced.","Germany,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,banking"

""This program has been a disaster,"" Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month.

After $1 billion and 12 years of effort, Defense officials have pulled the plug on a hapless plan to bring the four military branches under a single, modern payroll and personnel records system.

""Many of the programs that I have made decisions to cut have been controversial within the Department of Defense,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates told senators. ""This one was not.""

The object of so much disaffection is the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS), known as ""dime-ers.""

Gates clearly wasn't a fan of the title or program, which at its peak employed 600 military, federal civilians and private contractors who tried to use off-the-shelf technology to meld up to 90 automated systems that continue to run across the DoD.

""I would say that what we've gotten for a half billion dollars is an unpronounceable acronym,"" Gates quipped, though his cost estimate was short by half. The Government Accountability Office says a billion dollars had been spent on DIMHRS through 2009.

Its demise leaves the Army, Navy and Air Force still reliant on archaic, problem-plagued payroll and personnel systems. Required upgrades had been postponed again and again over the years, always in anticipation that all services would be moving to, and satisfied with, DIMHRS.

Last spring Defense officials finally and quietly advised the Army, Navy and Air Force they could pursue their own personnel and payroll system upgrades.

More than time and money had been lost. Military personnel, particularly Guard and Reserve members, increasingly have been frustrated by pay and personnel record errors. The Commission on the National Guard and Reserves urged two years ago that a single, integrated pay and personnel system was needed ""as soon as possible"" to rectify inadequacies in legacy systems.

More than 90 percent of Army Reserve and Guard soldiers activated to serve in Afghanistan and Iraq through 2003 reported significant pay errors. Aggressive actions were taken to lower that rate but without the benefit of what was needed — a modern integrated payroll system.

The current systems use programming language from the 1960s that are unable to handle complex changes. When new pays are adopted, it was taking the Army on average 12 to 18 months to automate. Some pays, like medical bonuses, can't be programmed and must be calculated manually.

DIMHRS was to relieve all of that. It would track assignments, process orders and show immediate changes to members' duty status to ensure timely, accurate pay, benefits and service credit.

The Marine Corps alone began a decade ago to move to a combined personnel and payroll system, the Marine Corps Total Force System. The Navy as far back as 2006 wanted to adopt the Marine system but Congress balked, with GAO noting that $668 million already had been invested in DIMHRS.

According to this report in the Wall Street Journal,Toyota hired Exponent in December ""to understand customer reports and claims of unintended acceleration in vehicles."" Exponent bought six Toyota and Lexus vehicles all equipped with the ETCS-i system (Electronic Throttle Control System with intelligence) for its testing, the WSJ says.

In a press release, Toyota said that, ""The interim report, dated February 4, 2010, notes that Exponent was unable to induce unintended acceleration in any of the ETCS-i equipped Toyota and Lexus vehicles it tested. In all cases, the vehicle either behaved normally or entered a fail-safe mode where engine power was significantly reduced or shut off.""



Toyota also said that it had given the report to Congress in anticipation of the up-coming hearings in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.

Toyota's attorney sent a letter to the House committee late last week saying that Toyota had carried out exhaustive tests and doesn't think there are any electronic problems with its vehicles, but promised to look into the problem again, says this AP news report.

The letter also says that Toyota is considering expanding brake override capability to additional models beyond those listed in its recalls.

Toyota promises more information Wednesday about the progress of the recall of more than 400,000 Prius cars in which the anti-lock braking software is being replaced.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,,Impact - Raw,Toyota"

Many in the car business couldn't understand Toyota's dogged resistance to including this feature in its cars.



In addition, the LA Times reports that Toyota is considering a recall of its popular Corolla subcompact because of consumer complaints with the car's power steering. This story last week in Automotive News says that drivers ""have compared the movement to being buffeted by strong winds, sliding on black ice, or hydroplaning.""

Also last week, Toyota announced a voluntary recall of 8,000 of its 2010 Tacoma four-wheel-drive pickups for possible cracks in their front drive shaft that might cause it to separate, as well as that it was also going to look into complaints of sudden acceleration in 2005 and later model Tacoma's as well, USAToday reports. This investigation goes beyond the floor mat issue that the Tacoma was already being recalled for.

Further, a Wall Street Journal article reports today that president Toyoda said that he was going to personally lead a new global quality-control task force. Shinichi Sasaki, Toyota Executive Vice President provided more details about this global quality initiative here.

That action will not likely impress the US government which is now demanding that Toyota turn over all documents related to the various recalls to determine what Toyota knew and when did it know it. Toyota can be fined up to $16.4 million if US regulators believe it did not initiate a recall in a timely manner. Toyota said it is cooperating with the US in these matters.

Finally, there is a story in the Financial Times of London that reports that Toyota is now facing dozens of lawsuits that could cost it billions of dollars in damages. Lawsuits have been filed not only claiming personal injuries from car defects, but also from Toyota dealers, car auction and others who demanding compensation for Toyota's freeze on sales of 8 of its recalled models. Other lawsuits are demanding compensation for loss of resale value of Toyota cars.

Things can't get much worse for Toyota, unless electronics are indeed found to be a cause of sudden acceleration in some of its vehicles.","Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,,Impact - Raw,Toyota"

This was counter to what the NTSB had expected to find.

Quoting from the release,

""The safety study, which was adopted unanimously by the Safety Board, was initiated more than a year ago to determine if light airplanes equipped with digital primary flight displays, often referred to as ""glass cockpits,"" were inherently safer than those equipped with conventional instruments. The study, which looked at the accident rates of over 8,000 small piston-powered airplanes manufactured between 2002 and 2006, found that those equipped with glass cockpits had a higher fatal accident rate then similar aircraft with conventional instruments. The Safety Board determined that because glass cockpits are both complex and vary from aircraft to aircraft in function, design and failure modes, pilots are not always provided with all of the information they need - both by aircraft manufacturers and the Federal Aviation Administration - to adequately understand the unique operational and functional details of the primary flight instruments in their airplanes.""

Nearly all newly manufactured piston-powered light airplanes are equipped with digital primary flight displays, the NTSB says, and older aircraft are increasingly becoming retrofitted with them as well.

Improved training is seen as a key to gaining the benefits of these improved displays.

NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman is quoted in the press release as saying, ""The data tell us that equipment-specific training will save lives. To that end, we have adopted recommendations today responsive to that data - recommendations on pilot knowledge testing standards, training, simulators, documentation and service difficulty reporting so that the potential safety improvements that these systems provide can be realized by the general aviation pilot community.""

The full NTSB study will be released in a few weeks. When it does, I will post more of its details.

2010-03-01T07:00:00Z,New York City $68 Million Payroll and Time Keeping System Now Costs $722 Million," Project out of control, investigations begun ",,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/can-you-top-this-68-million-new-york-city-project-is-now-722-million-and-counting,true,Can You Top This? $68 Million New York City Project Is Now $722 Million and Counting,"Defense programs routinely overrun their original budgets, but I can't recall one reaching the level of ""special achievement"" that the CityTime project of New York City has been able to accomplish.

CityTime, according to New York City's Office of Payroll Administration (OPA): ...""is a secure, web-based time and attendance system for the 80 Mayoral and other Agencies of the City of New York that:

Provides objective and consistent application of citywide compensation rules and policies as defined by collective bargaining agreements.

Automates the generation of pay and leave transactions.

Automatically sends leave, overtime, and timesheets to the appropriate supervisors for approval.

Interfaces with Payroll Management System (PMS) for pay and leave processing.""

The CityTime system - assuming that it is finally completed - will cover 140,000 city workers who, instead of filling out paper timesheets, will need to scan their hands into a biometric reader to record their comings and goings. The system currently covers 45,000 employees, 19,000 of whom must use it to clock in and out each day and during their lunch hours. City workers earning more than $68,000 don't have to use the palm scanners, which makes the New York City unions angry.

The project was initiated in 1998 at an estimated cost of $68 million, but I can't find an originally estimated time to complete anywhere. However, this 2008 CityLimits article says the project contract, which I assume includes system maintenance, could run to 2021.

The current estimated cost to complete is now placed at a whopping $722 million, with some $670 million of that going to the defense contractor SAIC for the system's development. According to this article in the New York Daily News, most of the remaining tens of millions have been spent on outside contract and project management to control the project's cost and quality: I guess that was money well spent, huh?

As a bit of background, in this January 2007 New York Times article, the project cost was given as ""only"" $181.1 million, and the estimated completion time was set for 2009. (Interestingly, in this 2 October 2006 SEC filing, SAIC placed their total CityTime contract value at $375 million - a discrepancy that I cannot find explained anywhere.)

In this March 2008 CityLimits story, the project cost had risen to $348 million, while this May 2008 CityLimits story says that the contract had been amended some 8 times since its original signing.

In December 2009, this New York Daily News story said that the city government kept modifying the contract every six months to ensure no one could figure out the final project cost. In fact, the Daily News story reported that Mayor Michael Bloomberg in September of last year quietly added $140 million more in funding to the project's contract, even though the city was (and still is) facing massive financial (and apparently common sense) deficits.

Mayor Bloomberg earlier this month admitted that the CityTime project was a ""disaster"" but he didn't explain how he was going to fix it. He also compared it to developing the next generation air traffic control system - a bit of hyperbole, me thinks.

In February, City Controller John Liu decided to audit the contract - the first such audit (or any outside review) of theproject since it started nearly twelve years ago. Is there some rule that New York City IT projects don't trigger an audit until they have exceeded their original budgets by a factor of ten?

Friday's New York Daily News has an article claiming the top eleven CityTime project managers are being billed to the contract at more than $600,000 per year, while some 230 project consultants are being billed at an average $400,000 per year. Nice work if you can get it, I suppose.

OPA claims that CityTime will eventually save the city $60 million per annum - unfortunately, that amount will likely never cover the cost overrun on the project.

By the way, if anyone knows of an IT project over $50 million that has exceeded its budget by more than 10 times and still hasn't been canceled, let me know. I can't find any in my archives.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,,Impact - Raw,payroll"
2010-03-01T07:00:00Z,Queensland Health AU$101 Million Payroll System Rollout a Fiasco, Original cost was AU$6.2 Million ,,,,,,,6200000,$,AUD,Australia,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/outstanding-success-or-nightmare-payroll-system-lawsuit-may-decide,,"""Outstanding Success"" or Nightmare Payroll System: Lawsuit May Decide","Alas, another case of how not to acquire a government IT system, this time, in the Australian State of Queensland.

To bring you quickly up-to-speed: on the 24th of March, a new payroll system was rolled out for the Queensland Health service which according to its web site is ""a network of 15 Health Service Districts and the Mater Hospitals, Queensland Health delivers a range of integrated services including hospital inpatient, outpatient and emergency services, community and mental health services, aged care services and public health and health promotion programs.""

Queensland Health has approximately 78,000 employees on its payroll which are supposed to be paid on every second Wednesday.

Since the new payroll system went live, however, thousands of Queensland Health staff have had continuing payroll issues.

As of this week, the new payroll system still isn't working properly with many Queensland Health staff still not getting paid; some getting paid incorrectly; some employees who had quit a year ago (or died) still getting paid; some getting paid but with blank payroll slips to tell them what was taken out of their pay; and some staff even quitting over the problem

Queensland Health IT staff are so fed up with trying to fix the payroll problems, they are even threatening a stop-work action.

The problems have sparked an investigation by the Queensland Auditor-General who lays out a tale of woe in a report that is, unfortunately, all too familiar sounding.

The new payroll system, called the Continuity Project, was a replacement for an old and creaky LATTICE payroll system installed in 1997 that was unreliable and no longer supported by its vendor. IBM was contracted on 1 January 2008 to develop a replacement payroll system at a cost of A$6.19 million (fixed price) and a go-live date of 1 July 2008.

IBM was actually contracted to CorpTech, which the Queensland Auditor-General report on the fiasco, says is a ""specialised business unit of Treasury Department and subsequently Department of Public Works providing a whole-of-government role over the acquisition of information technology.""

CorpTech acts in many ways like a US federally funded research and development center (FFRDC).

When the IBM developed payroll system went live in March, it was the seventh go-live date - the previous six having been missed.

The total cost of the project (including CorpTech's management oversight and Queensland Health involvement) is as of the end of March, A$101.96 million, including A$21 million for IBM's effort (not counting another A$3.3million that is owed to IBM).

What happened to IBM's fixed price? It when out the window when stakeholders couldn't agree on the payroll system requirements.

According the Auditor-General's report, bickering stakeholders (the report terms the bickering more nicely as ""confusion over roles and responsibilities"") was only a small part of the project's problem.

Even after spending A$900,000 on system and requirements analysis, IBM assumed that the new payroll system would be ""a 'like for like' replacement, using the Department of Housing’s SAP system with very little customisation.""

Or as the report states:

""The underlying assumption stated by IBM in the Statement of Scope was: ‘Our understanding is that there is a relatively small amount of functionality required as a minimum to make the interim solution functional for Queensland Health that it is relatively small in nature.""

Unfortunately, the Department of Housing SAP payroll system supported only 1,300 employees and had only one pay award structure. Queensland Health 78,000 employees have 13 pay awards and multiple industrial agreements which provide for over 200 different allowances, and in excess of 24,000 different combinations of calculation groups and rules, the Auditor-General report says.

Oops. IBM kind of missed that wee difference in system scale and complexity.

Another issue was that as the system was being developed and tested, no one could quite agree with what a ""defect"" meant. For instance, the report states that:

""During user acceptance testing, a large number of defects were identified and there was frequent tension between the parties over whether the defects were actual defects or changes in business requirements, which ultimately led to further change requests and increased project costs.""

In addition, defects were classified by defect severity, with Severity 1 defect being show stoppers; Severity 2 being major; Severity 3 being minor, and; Severity 4 defects being seen as cosmetic.

However, as the Auditor-General report notes:

""During the third iteration of user acceptance testing, the Project Board agreed at their 9 July 2009 meeting to revise the defect severity definitions. This decision resulted in a number of Severity 2 defects being downgraded to Severity 3 defects. The Project Board also agreed to change the exit criteria for the fourth iteration of user acceptance testing to identifying no Severity 1 defects and putting in place a comprehensive management plan (Solution and Defect Management Plan) for Severity 2, 3 and 4 defects. The Project Board was of the opinion that a number of Severity 2 defects had acceptable workarounds and would not result in incorrect pay calculations."" ""These changes had a significant effect on allowing the project to pass the exit criteria for user acceptance testing. The outstanding Severity 2, 3 and 4 defects were to be resolved progressively post Go-Live with the first fixes to be implemented in production prior to the first pay run.""

Furthermore, the Auditor-General report states, a full system and integration test was not performed before the new payroll system was rolled out: an executive decision was made to essentially make the Queensland Health employees beta testers, with any problems they discovered fixed on the fly. However, Queensland Health IT staff were not fully trained in how to make such payroll fixes quickly and effectively.

An apparent reason for foregoing a full system and integration test was that there was a worry that the risk of continuing with the LATTICE payroll system for much longer was higher than trying to fix any problems that came up after the new payroll system was rolled out.

The Auditor-General's report, along with these independent assessment reports to Queensland Health by KPMG make for interesting as well as sorry reading. There are many other reasons for the fiasco detailed in the reports along with a host of recommendations to avoid them in the future for those still curious.

The Queensland Government has now issued IBM a show-cause notice indicating its wish to terminate the contract as a means to withhold the A$3.3 million it still owes IBM. It may also seek damages for the 35,000 payroll defects uncovered so far.

However, IBM has stated that the payroll project, in its view, was an ""outstanding success"" and that it would vigorously defend its record.

This Brisbane Times story quotes an IBM spokesperson as saying:

""IBM has relentlessly and consistently delivered above and beyond the scope of the contract to assist Queensland Health identify and address concerns with its payroll process... Our commitment to supporting the Queensland Government in its mission to provide quality services to employees remains unchanged.""

So let the lawsuits begin!

After reading the reports, I think you'll agree that IBM wasn't solely at fault here: CorpTech, Queensland Health and the Queensland Government deservedly share the blame as well.

According to this report, fixing the payroll system will cost (at least) another A$4 million, although when it will be finally fixed is anyone's guess at the moment.","Australia,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,payroll"

According to this story from WFTV Channel 9 in Orlando, Florida, arriving passengers at Orlando International Airport had to wait for several hours to clear customs even after the computer was back in operation at about 2055. Passengers also could not call relatives or friends to tell them what had happened, because you can't use your cell phone while waiting to clear customs.

What I found interesting was that only three television stations in Florida (the two others being WSVN Channel 7 and WFOR Channel 4 both in Miami) carried the news story at all. There has been no print or web-only reporting that I can find. The Customs and Border Protection website has nary a word on it either.

In August of 2007, a computer meltdown at LAX caused problems with about 11,000 arriving passengers and that hit the national news across the country. At least that many passengers were affected across the country, I would guess.

2010-05-01T07:00:00Z,UK Scraps £4.5 Billion National Identity Register Project, £257 Million Investment wasted ,,,,,,,2.57E8,£,GBP,UK,Project Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,http://www.zdnet.com/article/id-cards-why-they-were-destined-to-fail/,,ID cards: Why they were destined to fail,"David Blunkett and others explain why the mega-IT project fell out of favour

In 2002 the Labour government revealed proposals to create a national UK ID card to combat identity fraud and international terrorism.

The card was to act as a guarantee of its holder's identity, courtesy of an embedded microchip that would hold biometrics such as the cardholder's fingerprints, photo and iris scans.

Over the next eight years the grand vision for the ID card was slowly reduced in scale, as the project's costs grew and the card's potential uses shrunk, while the scheme continued to become steadily more unpopular with the general public.

The ID cards project is no more, scrapped by the coalition government - but not before the previous Labour administration ploughed about £257m into the now defunct venture.

The ID cards project was in many ways destined to fail. Not long after it was proposed by then Home Secretary David Blunkett in 2002, politicians, academics and silicon.com itself pointed to the lack of clarity about how project's goals would be achieved at a reasonable cost to the public purse and individuals' privacy - two issues that would haunt the project throughout its life.

The card itself was hamstrung by the decision to turn it into a travel document allowing cardholders to travel within Europe, according to Gus Hosein, visiting fellow in the information systems and innovation group at the London School of Economics (LSE) and co-author of a report into the scheme.

""That became a specific design constraint around which everything started to fall apart afterwards,"" he said.

""That is because you have to design the card in such a way that it is globally interoperable, not necessarily nationally interoperable. Otherwise you would have had the freedom to create a card with a smart chip to authenticate identity when accessing services provided by the Department for Work and Pensions or other government departments or local government.

""Instead they designed a card whose primary purpose was to be read by foreign governments.""

According to Blunkett, the decision to turn it into a travel document had resulted from a desire to restrict the information that was given for the card, in order to quell concerns about the cards' impact on personal privacy, he told silicon.com.

""It had reached the point where people were suspicious of anything related to giving information - it's partly the success of groups like NO2ID and Privacy International.

""They were tossing handgrenades at something that didn't exist: the kind of incursion into privacy wasn't the intention of the ID card and biometric database and wouldn't have been the case.

""We got all tied up with civil rights and privacy when the intention was never to intrude on people's privacy at all,"" he told silicon.com.

Activist groups weren't the only ones expressing their disquiet with privacy issues surrounding the card, however: certain sectors of the government were also uneasy about the card.

""The card could have been used for a whole range of purposes if people were not so worried about the issues of intrusion,"" Blunkett said.

""For instance, it seems to me that the ID card and the driving licence could have been incorporated together but the Department for Transport were vehemently opposed to that in 2003/04 and that is why that didn't happen.""

This whittling down of the card's potential functionality was a phenomenon that dogged the card throughout its life.

The government also dropped plans to put iris scans on the card's embedded chip and decided not to include EMV technology that would have allowed the card to authorise transactions using chip and PIN.

This cutting back did not go unnoticed by industry, and in 2009 the cards stripped-back feature set was criticised by the UK card payments association, then known as Apacs, when its then head of security said that the card was devoid of useful features, such as the ability to use chip and PIN to authenticate transactions.

As the card's functionality dwindled, the gap between the government's ambitious promises for what the project would deliver and the capabilities of the project being delivered by the IPS continued to grow.

Sold in its early days by the government as a means of fighting terrorism and stamping out ID fraud, by 2009 it was reduced to being touted as a proof of ID when buying booze or getting into nightclubs or as a travel document to journey within Europe - even when the card was only available to those holding a valid passport in the first place.

Hardware too failed to keep pace with the ID cards grand vision: in February last year silicon.com revealed that the UK government had not rolled out a single reader for ID cards' embedded microchip, despite introducing ID cards for foreign nationals at the end of 2008.

Card readers had not even been included in the IPS' 10-year cost projections for the ID cards scheme and Home Office officials admitted that most of ID checks using the cards would be a simple visual comparison between the cardholder and the photo on the card's front, a check that is already possible with driving licences and passports.

Despite cuts to its functionality and delays to hardware rollouts, the scheme was still slated to cost £5bn - a figure which it should be noted also included the cost of providing and issuing biometric passports. The government said that the majority of the project would be financed by the £30 fees paid by the public who took up the card - a vain hope, as it turned out.

Given the lack of uses for the card it is perhaps unsurprising that the take up of the card among the British public was less than overwhelming.

Since the cards were first made available to certain British nationals in October 2009 - starting with civil servants working in Manchester and London - to the announcement of the scheme's cancellation last month, only about 13,200 cards were issued.

Airport workers and airline crew at Manchester and London City airports were one such group who were chosen to receive the cards ahead of the cards rollout to the general population but who chose to resist the scheme.

A spokesman for the national pilot's union Balpa told silicon.com that it had opposed the scheme because the cards failed to provide what its members wanted.

""The government did not offer us any consultation on what we wanted from ID cards, that was the reason for our opposition,"" he said.

""At the moment pilots have to carry different cards for every airport [in the UK], what we wanted from the scheme was a single card that allows pilots to access all airports.""

As a result of the opposition from the unions the government dropped plans to make the cards compulsory for all airport and airplane staff operating out of Manchester and London City airports, and made the cards available voluntarily instead.

The upshot was that take-up of the cards remained low: ""I do not know a single pilot that applied for one - there might have been a handful at most,"" the Balpa spokesman said.

Attempts to offer the cards in specific regions of the UK - first Manchester, then the North West, young people living in London and then to any British national who had registered an interest in the scheme - generated a similarly lacklustre response.

People living in the Manchester area had chosen not to pay £30 to get an ID card because they could see little reason for doing so, Manchester Withington MP John Leech told silicon.com.

""Some people are fundamentally opposed, but most people don't see any real benefit to having one,"" he said.

""As soon as the scheme became voluntary it was always going to be a spectacular failure.""

Earlier this year at an event Bob Carter, public key infrastructure and encryption expert for the ID cards scheme at the IPS, told silicon.com that the first generation card was ""a tactical card that we have put out very quickly"" and the Labour government was considering introducing an improved ID card in 2012 which would have come with additional functionality - a card that will now, of course, not see the light of day.

Blunkett maintains that he always made it clear that the majority of uses for the ID card would only become viable once the bulk of the UK population held a card, adding that the Labour government had been careful not to oversell the capabilities of the cards in the early days of the project.

""I have always said [the scheme] would not have delivered until we had near universal take-up - probably in six years' time,"" he said.

""We did our best from 2002 to 2005 to damp down expectations in every interview.

""I made clear that this was not a panacea. It wasn't going to stop 100 per cent of benefit fraud or misuse of free health service by people from outside the country, it wasn't going to guarantee security against the terrorist threat.

""It was a contribution to [dealing with] each of them, based on the fact that you could have proved your identity beyond doubt.""

Given the difficulties with getting the British public to accept ID cards, Blunkett himself now feels it would have been better not to have embarked on the ID card scheme, and to simply have made it compulsory for everyone in the UK to hold a passport which included a chip bearing their digital photo and fingerprint scans.

""Given where we are now it would have been sensible to have simply said we were going to have a universal passport - that everybody in the country would have a passport and second generation biometrics would have been taken as part of that,"" he said.

""Then future usage could have been added once people were comfortable with that.""

In trying to satisfy a mishmash of demands for what the ID card should be, without a clear idea of how to get there, the government ended up spending hundreds of millions of pounds to provide an ID card that nobody wanted.

The resultant muddle of a card ended up satisfying no one, not even the man who dreamt up the ID cards scheme in the first place.","UK,Project Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,£,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

Waste Management's suit lodged an array of colorful allegations against SAP, including a charge that company executives used a ""fake"" software demonstration to trick the trash hauler into believing SAP's products would meet its needs.

Waste Management had been seeking more than $1 billion in damages from SAP, but the parties entered mediation in March 2010 and soon reached an agreement for the $80 million, according to SAP's complaint against Swiss Re, which was filed last month in a Delaware court. The action was removed last week by Swiss Re to U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

SAP had told Swiss Re, one of its liability insurance providers, that the settlement was imminent, and a policy SAP acquired from Swiss Re in 2007 granted the company A!15 million ($18.5 million) in coverage, its complaint adds.

Swiss Re didn't object to the settlement but also wouldn't commit to paying its share of the $80 million, according to SAP.

At one point in February 2011, Swiss Re's law firm told SAP that there were ""several arguments"" it could make ""to avoid providing insurance coverage to SAP"" under the policy's terms, the complaint states.

While SAP and Swiss Re recently spent a number of months discussing a mediation process, ""those negotiations have broken down,"" SAP added.

In contrast, a number of other insurers, including AIG Europe, have made payments in full according to the policies SAP held with them, the complaint adds.

SAP is demanding ""all amounts due"" from Swiss Re as well as assorted damages and other costs.

Swiss Re's notice of removal doesn't directly address SAP's allegations. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.

SAP's lawsuit is sure to spark some tensions between the two companies, which have a history outside the disputed insurance policy. In 2007, they announced that Swiss RE would use SAP software to ""to harmonize and consolidate its global human resources, finance and logistics processes.""

New York Stock Market Trading Goes Haywire,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) dropped nearly 1,000 points yesterday from Wednesday's close in a span of about 20 minutes before rebounding and finally closing down 346.51 points at 10,520.32.

An ABC News television story last night showed that the market, which was off by nearly 500 points already in the day because of the nervousness created by the reaction in Greece to the proposed EU - IMF bailout, dropped 587 points between 1442 EDST and 1448 EDST alone.

Company stock prices gyrated wildly. A Washington Post story today says, ""The shares of Accenture, a consulting firm, fell from $40 to a single penny and then back to $40 again. Procter & Gamble traded at $54 on the New York Stock Exchange. But at the same time, Nasdaq was reporting that the company's shares were selling for $39.""

One rumor floating around yesterday afternoon was that a trader at Citigroup made a ""fat finger"" trade; instead of selling $16 million of a S&P 500 futures-linked contract he (or she) typed in $16 billion instead. Citi denied the rumors last night.

Others blamed programmed trading that ran amok, while others said that there were problems in the ""circuit breaker"" programs that regulate trading. 3M, for instance, was reported to be trading below its circuit breaker price. This Nasdaq story explains why the market circuit breakers didn't kick in, although it does not address the 3M situation specifically.

Still others called it direct manipulation.

The Wall Street Journal just called it all baffling.

The Washington Post story quoted Ted Weisberg, president of Seaport Securities and a trader for more than 40 years, who summed it up this way:

""How did this happen? You've got to ask the SEC [US Security and Exchange Commission]. The bottom line is the government created a trading mechanism with a lot of different marketplaces. Now they probably have 40 or 50 different venues where stocks trade. I don't know what their rules are. The public doesn't understand. This is another perfect example of the government changing the ground rules, and we end up with unintended consequences.""

The Chicago Sun-Times also had a nice quote from Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial, who blamed the government less and human nature more, saying:

""... during periods of panic, information travels faster than knowledge and money moves faster than perspective.""

The SEC said last night it would be investigating the day's events, while the major markets said they would be unwinding any erroneous aka ""busted trades"" they discovered during the 20-minute meltdown.

For instance, the Sun-Times reports, ""An advisory from the Chicago Stock Exchange said the busted trades will be for prices that were at least 60 percent higher or lower than the previous trade.""

2010-05-01T07:00:00Z,Indiana and IBM Sue Each Other Over Cancelled Outsourcing Contract, Each points finger at other ,,,,,,,,,,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/indiana-and-ibm-sue-each-other-over-failed-outsourcing-contract,true,Indiana and IBM Sue Each Other Over Failed Outsourcing Contract,"Last October, the State of Indiana decided to terminate its 10-year, $1.34 billion contract with IBM to privatize the state's welfare system. Among the reasons given was IBM's alleged mishandling of welfare claims; before the contract, the rate was just 4.38% but it had climbed to 18.2% by July of that year.

In its place, the state said it would develop a hybrid system incorporating what it called the ""successful elements of the old welfare delivery system"" and a ""modernized system."" This hybrid system would include more face-to-face contact and more localized team-based case management.

At the time, an IBM spokesperson said, ""IBM rejects the state's claims [of non-performance] and believes the state's actions are unjustified. IBM will take action as appropriate to protect its rights under its contract with FSSA [Indiana's Family and Social Services Administration] .""

Well, this week both IBM and the State of Indiana decided the appropriate action was to duke it out in court.

According to multiple stories in the Indianapolis Star (here, here, here and here), the state paid IBM $437.5 million of its $1.34 billion, 10-year outsourcing contract, along with an additional $2.64 million in closing costs. The state also says that IBM has submitted over $125 million in additional the company claims it is still owed under the contract.

Indiana has told IBM that not only will it not be paying the $125 million, but it in fact wants its $437 million back and more.

As reported in this Indy Star article,

""Marcus Barlow, a spokesman for FSSA, said the state, in its lawsuit, is seeking reimbursement of every dime it has paid IBM; reimbursement of all overtime state employees incurred because of problems with IBM’s performance; and also wants IBM to be responsible for any federal penalties or damages from any lawsuits filed by others because of the welfare system’s shortcomings.""

IBM, in turn, has decided to counter-sue Indiana, claiming that it is owed both the $437 million as well as the $125 million it has billed the state, and that it isn't responsible for any other current or future damages.

You can read Indiana's court filing here, and a redacted version of IBM's here, courtesy of the Indy Star.

What is fascinating to me is how nasty things have gotten.

The state is claiming that IBM's outsourcing efforts were totally worthless, which has gotten IBM more than a little bit miffed.

In fact, a state spokesperson yesterday called the IBM lawsuit nonsensical, and that it was trying to take credit for the success of the new, hybrid system. Quoting from the Indy Star, spokesperson Barlow said,

""How they [IBM] can say with a straight face that they in any way helped the state is mindboggling.""

An IBM spokesperson named Clint Roswell was then quoted in the same Indy Star article as saying that IBM ""can certainly say with a very straight face that they are using IBM technology; that’s why this program is working. The hybrid is just a matter of adding some more bodies to it.""

IBM spokesperson Roswell was further quoted in today's Indy Star article as saying,

""It's our services. It's our hardware. It's our software. It's our databases, our whole system that we set up, and now they're using and they don't want to pay for it.""

But the state says in its lawsuit that it ""was left with virtually nothing of value from IBM's failed performance and indeed is faced with expending hundreds of millions of dollars in reprogramming and eventually entirely replacing IBM's failed systems.""

There's more, but you get the picture.

Ah, there are few things that can match watching an IT-related legal dispute play out in the press for its pure entertainment value.

Risk Factor readers can feel free to set the initial odds on:

the State of Indiana getting all $437 million back; IBM getting to keep the $437 million and getting paid the $125 million it says it's owed; the State of Indiana getting some of the $437 million back; IBM getting to keep the $437 million and gets paid only some of the $125 million it says it's owed; Indiana and IBM agreeing that $437 million is fair and appropriate, and the $125 million claim being dropped; a compromise being worked out that is kept confidential, with each side saying it won.

At the time, several news reports were warning that many UK taxpayers would likely be paying too much tax this year for a whole host of reasons such as being placed in an incorrect tax bracket because of errors in the HMRC database.

At the time, the HMRC downplayed the complaints and warnings and ""insisted the IT behind the new system is working as it should.""

Well, now the HMRC is admitting that at least 100,000 taxpayers have erroneously paid too much tax because of errors in - surprise, surprise - its computer systems.

According to this story in the London Telegraph, the HMRC also says that pensioners are the hardest group hit since they have the most complicated tax codes.

The Telegraph story goes on to say that,

""Examples of errors include people having their personal tax allowances removed, being placed on higher tax codes or even having a '1' inserted in front of their salary, erroneously inflating up their taxable income by £100,000.""

In other words, problems the HMRC was warned about in January along with some new ones.

In addition, the Telegraph reports that taxpayers are having a hard time getting through to HMRC help lines, and are sometimes being cut-off before they can report their problems.

An HMRC spokesperson was quoted in the Telegraph story as saying that the HMRC apologized for the problems, and that, ""Unfortunately with a project of this scale things will occasionally go wrong...""

The County said it decided to go to court after mediation talks proved fruitless.

According to the Marin Independent Journal, Marin County is accusing Deloitte of ""fraud, misconduct and misrepresentation"" in its customization, configuration and installation of the County's financial, Human Resources and payroll functions as part of their MERIT (Marin Enterprise Resource Integrated Technology) system. The MERIT system initially went live in July 2006 and Marin County claims it has been having trouble with it ever since.

It states in this Contra Costa Times story, that:

""The top-shelf SAP system installed by Deloitte cost about $20 million, or $4 million more than expected, while requiring work from a $600,000-a-year team of consultants. The SAP software package of 15 programs cost about $1 million. Deloitte Consulting got an initial $9 million for customization, configuration and installation work, then $2.4 million more in overruns when the county couldn't cope with what it bought."" ""A county grand jury investigation last year put all costs, including staff time spent since the installation on trying to make it work, at about $29 million - and counting.""

According to the lawsuit, the County claims that ""Deloitte wrongfully used the County's former project manager, Ernest Culver, as part of a scheme to conceal risks on the project from county executives,"" and furthermore, that Mr. Culver ""sign(ed) off on substandard, deficient or uncompleted work that Deloitte claimed to have performed and that, in some cases, other county employees had rejected.""

Mr. Culver, the Journal article says, left Marin County and joined SAP as a sales executive in 2007.

In addition, Marin County claims that Deloitte used inexperienced personnel on the effort instead of the experienced staff it had expected and had been promised. As a result, the County claimed it was little more than a Deloitte ERP ""guinea pig.""

The projected cost of the County's lawsuit against Deloitte may top $2 million.

Deloitte vigorously denies the County's charges, saying that it had performed all work to the satisfaction of the County and that the MERIT system was working when it left. Deloitte also said that it was confident that it would prevail in court. In fact, it was still owed $444,171.50 in unpaid change orders, plus a late fee of $111,713.80 this San Francisco Business Times article says.

Deloitte plans to file a lawsuit to get the money it says Marin County still owes it.

You can read a 2009 Marin County Grand Jury report outlining the many problems with the MERIT implementation here.

What you will find in it are all the usual suspects:

poor system requirements and specification; inadequate experience on the part of both the government and contractor management and implementation teams; inadequate customer involvement; inadequate testing; inadequate customer training; a rushed scheduled, and so on.

A friend of mine, Phil Simon, has written a book, Why New Systems Fail (recently released in its second edition) on why ERP-type systems go bad and how you can (try) to keep them from doing so.

According to news reports like this one in Reuters, Deutsche Bank's proprietary trading unit in Japan mistakenly placed sell orders of Y16.7 trillion ($182 billion) at the Osaka Securities Exchange on Tuesday when it first opened.

The reason was a software problem.

The Sydney Morning Herald quotes a spokesperson for Deutsche Bank's as saying,

""There was a software glitch in our automated trading system, and the consequence of the error was that a number of trades were repeatedly sent to the exchange... The error was recognised and we immediately placed cancel orders on 99.7 per cent of the trade. There is an issue somewhere in the software that needs to be identified.""

A software ""issue somewhere""? Not exactly a confidence building statement, is it.

Deutsche Bank said that it has suspended its proprietary trading in Japan until it is sure the problem won't reappear while the Osaka Securities Exchange says that it is investigating the incident.

The error caused the Tokyo Stock Exchange's Nikkei-225 futures index to lose 110 points or one per cent. If mistake hadn't been caught quickly, it could have caused a repeat of the Dow flash meltdown of a few weeks ago some analysts said.

Investigations into that incident are still underway with no root cause(s) specifically identified as of yet, although myriad theories abound.

In an article earlier this week in The Australian, Virgin Blue said the cutover to its new system (after two years of development effort) went smoothly.

The airline also said that during the 28 hour cutover period, its agents had to process passenger check-ins manually, so at least Virgin Blue's agents were well practiced for today's outage.

Last Friday, the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) sent an 8-page ""Notice to Cure"" letter to IBM in essence stating that in the state's opinion, IBM has failed to live up to the IT outsourcing promises it has made to the state since the contract's start.

As you may remember, in October of 2008, the Texas Governor suspended the $863 million, seven-year outsourcing contract that the state awarded to IBM in 2006 due to a variety of operational ""glitches"" that had, according to state officials, ""put state agencies in danger.""

The contract was restarted a short time later after IBM promised with hand over heart to make up for its performance shortfalls.

However, by the autumn of last year, the outsourcing contract was still a source of unhappiness. Once again, Texas and IBM negotiated and then agreed in principle in December to a new operational framework to resolve on-going deficiencies in contract performance, which IBM admitted still existed.

Well, on the 25th of June of this year, the DIR apparently had seen enough. It decided that IBM's promises to fix its on-going performance deficiencies were hollow and that IBM was, therefore, in breach of its contract.

The DIR press release dated 16 July states that:

""The accumulated effect of under-investment by IBM, poor performance, and continual disregard for the protective obligations of the MSA [Master Services Agreement], has resulted in harm to state agencies, exposure to unnecessary risks, and failure to achieve the objectives set and agreed by IBM.""

The DIR cure notice goes on to say that IBM ""has been unable and unwilling to bring itself into compliance"" with the outsourcing contract requirements.

The cure notice lists six material breaches of the contract, along with several other ""breaches of IBM's duties and obligations set forth"" in the outsourcing contract.

The six major material breaches include:

(1) failing to complete the transformation of the 27 state agencies into consolidated data centers on schedule; (2) failing to perform required back-ups of data for data recovery purposes [BTW, that was the reason for the 2008 contract suspension]; (3) failing to deliver a final interim disaster recovery plan for certain agency applications; (4) failing to provide sufficient and suitably qualified personnel; (5) failing to provide required security administration of IT systems, and; (6) failing to meet agreed to service performance levels.

The DIR says that IBM has 10 days to complete a plan that is acceptable to the DIR for curing the material breaches and correcting the other deficiencies, and that IBM must cure the contract breaches within 30 days.

Good luck with that!

While not explicitly stated, the next step would be for the DIR to begin to withdraw from the contract, although I don't see how this would be very practical this far along into the contract. The DIR had an opportunity to change course a few years ago, but that point has slipped on by. Holding up progress payments to IBM and taking the dispute public once more is probably the state's best - and maybe only - leverage.

In a related story in Government Technology, an IBM spokesperson denied the DIR allegations, saying:

""IBM has fulfilled its obligations under the contract and today's action by DIR was unnecessary and unjustified. .... IBM has worked in cooperation and good faith with DIR to provide benefits and improvements to all citizens of Texas. IBM very much regrets the state's action and will aggressively protect its interests going forward.""

This aggressive protection of its interests, no doubt, includes possibly suing the State of Texas as IBM did the State of Indiana when it pulled the plug on IBM's outsourcing contract there.

I suspect Texas will eventually cave like Virginia did with Northrop Grumman in its recent IT outsourcing contract dispute.","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,,Impact - Raw"

""Toyota's own vehicle evaluations have confirmed that the remedies it developed for sticking accelerator pedal and potential accelerator pedal entrapment by an unsecured or incompatible floor mat are effective. We have also confirmed several different causes for unintended acceleration reports, including pedal entrapment by floor mats, pedal misapplication and vehicle functions where a slight increase in engine speed is normal, such as engine idle up from a cold start or air conditioning loads."" ""Having conducted more than 4,000 on-site vehicle inspections, in no case have we found electronic throttle controls to be a cause of unintended acceleration. Toyota is committed to listening more attentively to our customers and continuing to investigate unintended acceleration concerns.""

Toyota's press release basically reiterated what it said last month.

Last week, says this story in USAToday, Steve St. Angelo, Toyota’s chief quality officer in North America, pressed the company's case further when he told the audience at a seminar hosted by the Center for Automotive Research that:

""Look, we're engineers; we're scientists. We thrive on finding something wrong. I am 100% confident that there is nothing wrong with our electronic throttle control systems.""

The New York Times stated that NHTSA reported that while it had received over 3,000 complaints involving sudden unintended acceleration, its investigators could only find fifty-eight crashes to study. The event data recorders in the vehicles indicated that in thirty-eight of the vehicles, the brakes were not applied before the crash. The Times story says this suggested ""the possibility that the drivers had mistakenly floored the gas pedal instead of the brake.""

In fourteen crashes, the brakes were applied, but in nine of those cases, the brakes were applied late. In one crash, both the brake and the gas pedal were applied. In the remaining seven cases, no useful data could be found.

Furthermore, the Times story notes, ""... the government investigators, by examining the vehicles and interviewing the drivers in addition to downloading data, found one instance of the accelerator pedal’s becoming stuck under the floor mat, and no cases of a sticky pedal.""

Critics pointed the NHTSA findings shouldn't be viewed as the final answer to the question of SUA in Toyota vehicles, since the event data recorders aren't designed to provide information indicating sudden unintended acceleration in non-crash situations, and the NHTSA data may be biased.

NHTSA itself said to be careful about interpreting the initial findings. This LA Times article says that:

""Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration head David Strickland told three members of Congress in the briefing that the agencies had drawn 'no conclusion' on the causes of sudden acceleration and noted that investigations by NHTSA, NASA, and the National Academy of Sciences were ongoing, with final results a year or more away.""

And one can expect the court cases against Toyota in regard to SUA to drag on much longer than that.","US,Operational Failure,Other,,,Auto and Land Transport,,Impact - Raw,Toyota"

According to the Sun, nearly 80,000 State Farm customers in Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia who have monthly premiums automatically debited from their bank account were affected.

State Farm said that it became aware of the problem on Wednesday, and that the problem was corrected by yesterday. The company added, however, that its customers should check their statements anyway and let it know if the problem was not fixed.

The Sun noted that State Farm had another billing problem in May of this year. Nearly 12,500 Visa credit card customers of State Farm Bank were erroneous charged as much as $20,000. That error was a result of a ""coding error"" at the Bank's credit card billing vendor.

In related billing problem news, the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) is warning anyone who used a credit or debit card (except the AAFES Military Star cards) between the 7th and 9th of August at any of its locations world wide to check their card statements for billing anomalies.

An AAFES spokesperson says in this Stars and Stripes article that the problem, which was found on the 10th of August, was due to a computer security upgrade:

""During the implementation of a Payment Card Industry application change to provide added protection to customer data through encryption, files with duplicate credit data were transmitted to the credit processing center in error.""

AAFES also said customers who were affected didn't have to do anything, although it may take a few weeks for the fix to show up in a customer's billing statement.

AAFES has not said how many of its customers were affected. However, according to the AAFES fact sheet, it operates 3,100 facilities serving 12.2 million customers in 30 countries. So the number is likely to be pretty large.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected"
2010-08-01T07:00:00Z,Honda Updates Software on 2006-2008 Civic Hybrids to Extend Failing Batteries, Batteries degrading prematurely ,,,,,,,,,,Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/transportation/advanced-cars/software-fix-extends-failing-batteries-in-20062008-honda-civic-hybrids-is-cost-acceptable,true,Software Fix Extends Failing Batteries in 2006-2008 Honda Civic Hybrids: Is Cost Acceptable?,"There was a long and interesting story over the weekend in the Los Angeles Times about Honda Civic hybrids, their degrading batteries, a software fix, and its acceptability to the different interested parties involved.

Apparently, some of the batteries in second generation Honda Civic hybrids, which went into production 5 years ago, are failing prematurely. To extend the life of the batteries, Honda has developed a free software fix for the 2006 - 2008 Civic hybrids affected which Honda told the Times is designed to improve the car's performance.

The software fix, the Times says, "".. tunes the Honda hybrid system, known as Integrated Motor Assist, to limit cycling the battery, which means the electric motor often won't kick in to give an added power boost when accelerating. It also curtails how often the gasoline engine will shut down when the car is at rest, such as at a red light, a key fuel-saving feature in hybrids.""

However, some Honda Civic hybrid owners are complaining that the software update may be indeed extending the life of their car's battery, but at the cost of poor gas mileage and sluggish car performance. One owner said his mileage had dropped from 45 miles per gallon to only 33, which the Times notes, is scarcely better than a conventional Civic costing thousands less. Other Civic owners, however, say they haven't noticed any problems after receiving the fix.

By providing the software fix, the Times story indicates that Honda has been able to avoid replacing the failing batteries, which are still under warranty. In California, there is a 10-year,150,000-mile warranty requirement on the components of the hybrid system. Honda's policy is not to replace hybrid batteries until they are completely dead.

Honda disputes that saving itself money was the reason for the fix. A Honda spokesperson was quoted by the Times as saying:

""This is certainly not a financial decision... This is not just to prolong the life of the battery, it also helps improve the [car's] performance.""

The battery degradation issue has now caught the notice of both California and federal regulators because of potential environmental and safety issues. The Times story says that Honda has ""swapped out more than 4% of the batteries in the 2006-08 Civic hybrids in California,"" which has exceeded the California Air Resources Board's ""threshold for acceptable failure."" The decrease in gas mileage in some of the Civic hybrids may violate state air pollution requirements as well.

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has become involved because of Civic hybrid owner complaints of a loss of power. Honda, the Times reported, believes battery degradation is not a safety issue, since the primary source of power in a Civic hybrid is its internal combustion engine.

The Times story notes that some Honda Civic hybrid customers are preferring not to get the software update after hearing about the possible performance problems. Some owners seem intent on replacing the 158-volt nickel-metal hydride battery themselves (estimated base retail price is $2,100, excluding shipping and installation) or are going to try and drive their cars until the battery completely dies, which will then have to be replaced under warranty.

It is an interesting engineering question whether the proposed software fix can really extend a Civic hybrid's deteriorating battery, by say an additional 5 to 7-plus years.

Any battery engineers out there who care to shed some light on the myriad of issues involved and the likelihood that the fix will indeed prolong an ""abnormally"" degraded Honda Civic hybrid battery's life through its remaining warranty period? For example, what is the ""expected degradation"" in a 158-volt nickel-metal hydride battery after 5 and 10-years, and what is the battery degradation level where the software fix is probably fruitless?

And are there any 2006 - 2008 Honda Civic hybrid owners who have received the software fix, and have experienced problems (or not?)","Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,,Impact - Raw"

In early August, a country review of the ERP system recommended that a new ERP system be procured, the Contra Costa Times reported. The review's report, the Times article says, stated that:

""For about the same amount of investment needed to fix SAP, we could move to a new system and have significantly lower ongoing operating costs... The reduced operating costs of a new system would save at least $8 million over the next 10 years. We would still use SAP for the next three years.""

The report also states:

""Although SAP is getting the basics done, we are still doing work-arounds and using up significant staff time because of the poor initial implementation... Almost one-third of the functionality that was promised has never been met.""

The Times article says that the county's Department of Information Services and Technology director estimates that it would cost about $5 million to ""fix and enhance"" the current ERP system, but only $2.5 million to purchase an ERP system today that can be tailored to meet the county needs (with maintenance costs only half as much as the current system as well).

Hmm... that still seems a wee bit optimistic to me.

Not to worry, though. The county has learned all the lessons from its currently botched ERP effort. This time the county will roll-out the new system in phases over the next two to four years, increase the training of its internal staff on the new system, and even closely monitor the project's progress!

Sounds like lessons from IT project management 101, but at least the county is saying the right things. It probably also needs to think about applying some aggressive risk management, especially concerning the myriad of risks (and costs) involved in operating parallel IT systems for awhile.

One area where lessons apparently don't need to be learned, however, involves the process used under which the original system was procured. The county continues to insist it made a good business decision back in 2005.

A-huh.

2010-08-01T07:00:00Z,Texas Takes Back $863 Million IBM Outsourcing Contract, State says it is done with IBM ,,,,,,,,,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/texas-tells-ibm-make-way-for-others-on-outsourcing-contract,true,Texas Tells IBM: Make Way For Others on Outsourcing Contract,"Well, I sure got that wrong.

I was pretty confident that IBM and the State of Texas would reach some sort of mutually unacceptable accommodation in their disagreements over the quality and level of performance involving the outsourcing contract Texas awarded to IBM in 2006 that would allow everyone to save face and move on.

While I got the mutually unacceptable bit right, more importantly, I was way off about the two sides reaching an accommodation.

As you may recall, the Texas Department of Information Resources (DIR) sent an 8-page ""Notice to Cure"" letter to IBM last month in essence stating that in the state's opinion, IBM has failed to live up to the IT outsourcing promises it has made to the state since the contract's start.

The DIR gave IBM 10-days to come up with an acceptable cure plan, and 30-days to cure the contract breaches noted in the cure notice.

The 30-day period ended this week, with IBM declining to submit an acceptable plan, as well as in DIR's opinion, declining to fix the contract breaches noted in its cure letter.

On the Tuesday, the DIR sent a new letter to IBM stating that:

""On August 13, 2010, IBM delivered a letter to DIR that mischaracterized the obligations of IBM and DIR under the MSA, was insufficient to cure the breaches identified in the Notice to Cure Letter, and was little more than a reiteration of inconsistent and incomplete ideas that IBM has previously expressed. During discussions over the past nine months, IBM suggested that DIR re-procure all or part of the services under the MSA. Given IBM's failure to cure the breaches set forth in the Notice to Cure Letter, IBM now leaves DIR no course but to pursue procurement."" ""In accordance with the terms of the MSA, the Notice to Cure Letter specified that IBM had thirty (30) days to cure each such breach. IBM has failed to cure the identified breaches. Accordingly, DIR has full legal right and authority to terminate the MSA for cause. DIR has determined that it is not in the best interests of the State to exercise that right at this time. DIR will proceed with procurement for all services required of IBM under the MSA. DIR requires IBM’s full and compliant performance of its obligations under the MSA."" ""DIR expressly retains all rights with respect to termination of the MSA, and no delay in termination of the MSA shall be deemed a waiver of those rights.""

What this all means is that the DIR will take over control of the contract, and according to a story in the Dallas-Morning News, rebid much of the remaining work on the contract.

An article in the Austin-American Statesman states that the contract required the merger of the data centers of 28 Texas state agencies ""into two streamlined and secure facilities. The consolidation was supposed to be completed by December 2009 but is still only 12 percent complete.""

IBM disagrees with the DIR's stance, and is quoted in the Statesman as saying it is still ""hoping to continue a constructive dialogue"" with the DIR.

That doesn't look too likely.

I hesitate to make any predictions, given my previous track record, but I would guess an eventual trip to court looks better than a 50-50 chance.","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,Contract termination/cancellation"
2010-08-01T07:00:00Z,25 Virginia State Agencies Knocked Offline by Server Problems, Problems last nearly a week ,,,3,days,72.0,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/virginia-state-agencies-still-suffering-from-server-problems,,Virginia State Agencies Still Suffering From Server Problems,"On Wednesday afternoon, some of Virginia's computer servers had an as of yet unexplained failure which knocked some of the 24 state agencies off-line. The Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) said that how negatively an individual state agency was affected was due to where its information was stored on the state's servers.

The Department of Motor Vehicles apparently was the most visibly affected, with no in-person license renewals possible at its 74 locations across the state. However, one could still renew their license on-line or through its or use an automated telephone service, and vehicle registrations were still possible in-person.

VITA said that it had fixed the problem yesterday, but that many agencies were still affected at 1800 EDST news reports indicated. VITA officials couldn't say when everything would be back to normal. It's own website was still down as of 0930 EDST today but finally came back up shortly thereafter.

Virginias' IT infrastructure is in the midst of a major $2-billion plus upgrade which has been the source of trouble between the state and its contractor, Northrop Grumman.

2010-09-01T07:00:00Z,UK Scraps Vision for  All Encompassing National Electronic Health Record System Project, Move to local control ,,,,,,,,,,UK,Project Failure,Government,National,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/uk-centralized-national-electronic-health-record-system-vision-vaporized,true,UK Centralized National Electronic Health Record System Vision Vaporized,"It wasn't unexpected, nevertheless, the short announcement by the UK National Health Service (NHS) outlining the demise of a centerpiece of government health and IT policy for nearly a decade still was a bit surprising to read:

""The Department of Health review of the National Programme for IT has concluded that a centralised, national approach is no longer required, and that a more locally-led plural system of procurement should operate, whilst continuing with national applications already procured.""

With those words in an NHS press release yesterday, the political and technical vision creating the NPfIT, which was vigorously defended even as it was obvious to all that the vision and especially its implementation were severely flawed, ended.

The NHS press release continued:

""A new approach to implementation will take a modular approach, allowing NHS organisations to introduce smaller, more manageable change, in line with their business requirements and capacity. NHS services will be the customers of a more plural system of IT embodying the core assumption of ‘connect all’, rather than ‘replace all’ systems. This reflects the coalition government’s commitment to ending top-down government and enabling localised decision-making."" ""The review of the National Programme for IT has also concluded that retaining a national infrastructure will deliver best value for taxpayers. Applications such as Choose and Book, Electronic Prescription Service and PACS have been delivered and are now integrated with the running of current health services. Now there is a level of maturity in these applications they no longer need to be managed as projects but as IT services under the control of the NHS. Consequently, in line with the broader NHS reforms, the National Programme for IT will no longer be run as a centralised national programme and decision making and responsibility will be localised.""

The new direction for NPfIT means that it will still cost a significant sum - £11.4bn instead of the originally planned £12.7bn - government Health Minister Simon Burns said in the press release.

In addition, it still appears that the controversial summary care record will be rolled out as planned, privacy and security concerns notwithstanding. Without it, the new ""connect all"" NPfIT strategy is pretty worthless unless a new mechanism to simply and quickly exchange health information is developed.

Given this, I suspect there will be many more stories concerning the ""new NPfIT"" roll out for several more years yet.

It will now be interesting to see how BT and CSC, the two prime contracted suppliers of electronic health records to the NHS, react to the changes. Both of them have had problems delivering their EHR solutions to the NHS on time and budget and with acceptable quality, and now largely as a result of these problems, they have lost their respective guaranteed NHS EHR market shares. It makes the decisions by Accenture and Fujitsu to exit the program a few years ago looking like the right ones.

One lesson for the US effort to roll out a national health information network is that it is much, much harder and more expensive than it looks, no matter how compelling the business case for it is.","UK,Project Failure,Government,National,Health and Human Services,,,Impact - Raw"
2010-09-01T07:00:00Z,UK Government Tries to Quell Firestorm over Incorrectly Computed Taxes for 13.5 Million Taxpayers, HMRC computer system modernization to blame ,,,,,,1.35E7,,,,UK,Operational Failure,Government,National,Finance and Treasury,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/uk-government-moves-to-reduce-paye-system-political-fallout,,UK Government Moves to Reduce PAYE IT System Fiasco Political Fallout,"As I noted early last week, the UK's Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) computerized tax system fiasco had created a political firestorm.

After a review of tax returns by HM Revenue and Customs, some 4.3 million UK taxpayers were told that they had paid too much in taxes between 2008 and April of this year. The average sum they owe is about £400.

Furthermore, another 1.5 million UK taxpayers were told they would soon be receiving a letter from HM Revenue and Customs telling them that they owe on average £1,428 in taxes from the same period.

In addition, another 6 million UK taxpayers are likely owed tax refunds from years prior to 2008, while possibly another 1.7 million will owe taxes as well. And it may be four years before those owed a refund for taxes paid prior to 2008 see their money.

A major cause of all the taxes owed to the government as well as for the refunds is that many taxpayers were being placed in an incorrect tax bracket because of errors in the new HMRC computer system database.

The firestorm was fueled even further when this past Saturday, HM Revenue and Customs Permanent Secretary Dave Hartnett said in a BBC Radio 4 interview on the Money Box program that there was no need to apologize for asking that the taxes owed the government be paid or for the fact that millions of people had paid too much in taxes which needed to be refunded:

""I'm not sure I see a need to apologise... I've read the papers, listened to the media and heard stories of HMRC blunder and IT failure - neither of those are true.""

PS Hartnett also denied that the HMRC made any mistakes:

""We didn't get it wrong.""

This immediately infuriated the public and appalled politicians of all stripes who accused PS Hartnett of being arrogant, especially since report after report of problems with HMRC and its computing systems were published on a regular basis.

The huge outcry forced PS Hartnett to quickly retract his statements by Sunday morning. Many politicians also called for his immediate resignation or dismissal.

Then on Wednesday, the government tried to reduce the flames a bit more by saying that those who owed more than £2,000 in taxes will not have to pay interest on it, and that some 900,000 taxpayers who owed less than £300 would not have to pay it back at all (the previous limit had been £50).

However, showing a political tin ear, the HM Revenue & Customs chief executive Dame Lesley Strathie once more insisted, reports this London Daily Mail story, that HMRC staff had made ""no mistakes."" She in effect said it was a taxpayer's own fault if they owed back taxes or were to get a refund, and not the fault of the HMRC or its computer systems.

Dame Strathie also said the HMRC's performance was such because it couldn't pick and choose which customers to serve - it had to deal with everyone - whether her government department liked it or not.

Her statements went over like the proverbial lead balloon, and started a fresh round of criticism regarding HMRC management's unfailing ""arrogance.""

Adding to the depth and breadth of criticism was first the HMRC disclosure that a total of ""24 million people could have had their tax bills miscalculated over recent years"", and second, that HMRC had agreed to a deal that let the telecom company Vodafone avoid a £6 billion tax bill, and pay only a mere £3 million instead. HMRC refused to comment on the Vodafone deal, citing confidentiality rules.

Nothing like insisting that 1.4 million individual taxpayers pay the £2 billion in taxes they collectively owe or else face the unmitigated wrath of HMRC, while letting a large corporation escape paying three times that amount in taxes it owes and not explain why.

So far this week, HM Revenue and Customs has managed to put its foot, ankle and lower leg into its mouth. It will be interesting to see how further up its anatomy HMRC can go.

2010-09-01T07:00:00Z,FBI Takes Control of $550 Million Sentinel Program away from Lockheed, Program estimated to need ,,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/fbi-takes-control-of-sentinel-program-,true,FBI Takes Control of Sentinel Program,"There was a story in InformationWeek last week reporting that the FBI would now be taking over the management and much of the development work of the troubled $550 plus million Sentinel case management system program from prime contractor Lockheed Martin.

In March, US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Robert Mueller told the US House Appropriations Committee’s Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies that the follow-on to the notoriously failed $170 million Virtual Case File (VCF) program would once again slip its schedule and cost targets, as the FBI had decided to suspend development of the last two phases of the four total pending an internal review. In July, the FBI said it was contemplating bringing the management as well as the development work back inside the Bureau. Now it is official.

According to InformationWeek:

""The agency plans to use agile development processes to complete the project using its own employees and other technology partners, while reducing its reliance on Lockheed Martin.""

One reason, the InformationWeek story reported, was that a recent proposal by Lockheed Martin on the cost and time it required to complete the final two phases of the Sentinel program was ""not acceptable.""

InformationWeek quotes June Shrewsbury, Vice President of Lockheed’s security and citizen protection division, as saying:

""The FBI believes they have the ability to do things we can't do in a leadership role in a way that they can more affordably and efficiently implement the rest of the project requirements.""

I detect a note of skepticism there.

The FBI implies that it will be using agile development processes, beginning next month, to finish the project as a means to reduce program cost and budget risk. However, while the FBI still says that it still plans to deliver Sentinel by 2011, it isn't guaranteeing that date because agile development performance, it says, is hard to predict.

I am sure Congress is going to love hearing that when it asks about Sentinel's progress at the next set of hearings on the FBI.

Given the major new directions in both management and development practices the FBI is taking, I seriously doubt that a 2011 delivery is realistic. It is interesting to note that this major change in direction was caused by what FBI Director Robert Mueller termed in his March congressional testimony of this year as only ""minor"" technical issues.

Lockheed Martin will continue to support what it has already delivered, at least for the time being. Layoffs of some of its staff are highly likely.

I guess we can now finally bury the idea that Sentinel is a model program for government procurement.","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,,Impact - Raw,FBI VCF/Sentinel"

The system did not come back up until some 21 hours later.

News reports state that the glitch affected Virgin Blue flights at airports across Australia along with some Virgin Pacific international flights.

According to this report in the Sydney Morning-Herald, some 116 flights were canceled, while this report by ABC News says that passengers may still be feeling the impacts well into Tuesday.

The Morning-Herald quotes Virgin Blue group executive Andrew David yesterday as saying:

""About 50,000 passengers and 400 flights were affected.""

A story in Tuesday's early edition of The Australian now places the figure at 100,000 passengers being affected.

Mr. David also said, according to Sydney Morning-Herald, that the reservation and check-in system run by Navitaire had failed and there was no back-up method.

This story in IT News reports that there was a hardware problem at Navitaire, and the backup system which should have started within three hours, took 21 instead.

Tuesday's Australian story sheds a bit more light on the issue by stating that ""the solid-state disk server infrastructure used to host Virgin Blue's applications failed.""

Shades of the IT server problems last month in Virginia.

Navitaire, which is a subsidiary of Accenture, is likely to face a huge compensation bill in light of the failure, The Australian says.

Another Australian airline, JetStar, also uses Navitaire. It had two short reservation system interruptions on Sunday as well. The 68 other airlines that use Navitaire did not report any problems, however.

This is the second problem that Virgin Blue has had with its brand new reservation system in the last few months.

2010-10-01T07:00:00Z,Verizon Overbills 15 Million Customers for Years Due to Software Errors, $90 Million in overcharges ,,,10,months,7200.0,1.5E7,9.0E7,$,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/telecom/wireless/verizon-overbilled-15-million-customers-for-years-because-of-software-errors,,Verizon Overbilled 15 Million Customers For Years Because of Software Errors,"On Sunday, Verizon announced that it had ""discovered"" that it had over-billed about 15 million customers for several years because of a software error.

According to Verizon:

""... we discovered that over the past several years approximately 15 million customers who did not have data plans were billed for data sessions on their phones that they did not initiate. These customers would normally have been billed at the standard rate of $1.99 per megabyte for any data they chose to access from their phones. The majority of the data sessions involved minor data exchanges caused by software built into their phones; others included accessing certain web links, which should not have incurred charges. We have addressed these issues to avoid unintended data charges in the future.""

Most of the refunds or credits would amount between $2 to $6, although some customers, Verizon said, will receive larger amounts.

The total owed customers amounts to between $30 and $90 million.

Reading the Verizon press release, you would never guess that the reason Verizon ""discovered"" the billing error was because of customer complaints to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In fact, the New York Times reports that Verizon is in talks with the FCC over the complaints, something that the FCC confirmed today (see press release in PDF format).

The FCC said that it has been investigating what it called Verizon's ""mystery fees"" for the past ten months. Its inquiry was sparked by a column of a reporter with the Cleveland Plain Dealer that highlighted the hidden fees and the difficulty in trying to get them removed. The fees apparently have been appearing on Verizon customer bills since 2007.

The New York Times says that the FCC is now determining whether it should fine Verizon for its poor customer service and its failure to notify customers of the erroneous billing in a timely manner. The Times notes that:

""Customers who contacted Verizon about the charges said that the company had often refused to reverse the charges or discouraged them from blocking the data service on their phones.""

In fact, the Times said, in December 2009, Verizon downplayed the issue and said that customers were protected from minimal, accidental usage charges because Verizon Wireless did not charge users when their browser was launched, and opened to the Verizon Wireless Mobile Web homepage. Sunday's statement by Verizon seems to contradict that position, the Times notes.

While US telecoms aren't much admired for the quality of their customer service, they don't seem to be as bad in that department as telecoms in Australia.

The situation had gotten so bad there that in April, Australian Communications and Media Authority Chairman Chris Chapman decided to launch an investigation into complaints such as those from smart phone customers who have been complaining about rogue Internet data access charges.

The Australian quotes Chairman Chapman as saying:

""The poor complaint handling of the industry is legendary.""

Customer complaints about Australian telecom customer service have surged over seven plus years, with increases again seen this past year in both the number of complaints about customer service as well as the number of customer complaints involving the customer-complaint handling-procedures themselves of the telecoms.

Legislation forcing the telecoms to improve their customer service processes is being considered as part of Chairman Chapman's inquiry.

Another article in the Australian, this time from September, reports that the telecom industry's lobbying organizations - the Communications Alliance and the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association - have been trying to preempt any such legislation. The Australian says that they admit that there may be customer service problems, but they are in large part caused by technology-challenged customers.

2010-10-01T07:00:00Z,NYSE Flash Crash Cause Uncovered, Trading algorithm blamed ,,,20,minutes,0.3333333333333333,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/flash-crash-cause-found,,"Flash Crash ""Cause"" Found","It usually is never a good sign that a major government report is released on a Friday afternoon. Often it means that the contents don't reflect well on the government agency releasing the report.

Last Friday afternoon, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) finally released a 104-page report detailing the findings of their joint investigation (here in PDF format) into the so-called stock market ""flash crash"" on May 6th of this year

According to this article in the Financial Times of London, ""a $4.1bn sale of stock index futures by a single institutional investor who was hedging against the risk of a market downturn"" sparked the crash. The institutional investor - not named officially in the report but widely reported as Waddell & Reed - ordered an extremely quick sell order to be executed.

Waddell & Reed in mid-May denied it has caused the flash crash - and apparently still denies it.

The SEC/CFTC report states what happens in this fashion:

""Generally, a customer has a number of alternatives as to how to execute a large trade. First, a customer may choose to engage an intermediary, who would, in turn, execute a block trade or manage the position. Second, a customer may choose to manually enter orders into the market. Third, a customer can execute a trade via an automated execution algorithm, which can meet the customer’s needs by taking price, time or volume into consideration. Effectively, a customer must make a choice as to how much human judgment is involved while executing a trade."" ""This large fundamental trader chose to execute this sell program via an automated execution algorithm ('Sell Algorithm') that was programmed to feed orders into the June 2010 E-Mini market to target an execution rate set to 9% of the trading volume calculated over the previous minute, but without regard to price or time."" ""...the Sell Algorithm chosen by the large trader to only target trading volume, and neither price nor time, executed the sell program extremely rapidly in just 20 minutes."" ""... The Sell Algorithm used by the large trader responded to the increased volume by increasing the rate at which it was feeding the orders into the market, even though orders that it already sent to the market were arguably not yet fully absorbed by fundamental buyers or cross-market arbitrageurs. In fact, especially in times of significant volatility, high trading volume is not necessarily a reliable indicator of market liquidity.""

""What happened next is best described in terms of two liquidity crises - one at the broad index level in the E-Mini, the other with respect to individual stocks.""

Of course, to say that Waddell & Reed ""caused"" the flash crash is a gross overstatement that the SEC and CFTC acknowledge. What the ""flash crash"" report really exposed are the continuing problems in automated market systems that were first exposed in the Black Monday crash of October 1987, and which the regulators have been trying to play catch-up with ever since.

In its lessons learned section, the SEC/CFTC report states that:

""May 6 was also an important reminder of the inter-connectedness of our derivatives and securities markets, particularly with respect to index products.""

It also states that:

""... under stressed market conditions, the automated execution of a large sell order can trigger extreme price movements, especially if the automated execution algorithm does not take prices into account. Moreover, the interaction between automated execution programs and algorithmic trading strategies can quickly erode liquidity and result in disorderly markets.""

The FT interviewed Michael Yoshikami, the chief investment strategist at YCMNET Advisors, who summed up that SEC/CFTC report as being ""a good autopsy"" but that it failed to it answer the question about what the SEC and CFTC are going to recommend to increase trust and confidence in how the stock market operates.

The increase in trust and confidence is needed.

An AP-CNBC poll of investor confidence released in September indicated that 92% of the individual investors surveyed don't believe regulators ""have a firm grasp on Wall Street"", and that the flash crash was merely another indication of that. In addition the poll indicates that, ""Only 13% surveyed think the market is fair for small investors, while nearly 9 out of every 10 think it's perfectly fair for investment banks, hedge funds and professional traders.""

Mr Yoshikami went on to say that:

""We have one firm ... that according to the SEC really was the trigger of this whole cascade. When you consider the number of firms out there making trades the possibility this could happen again, in my opinion, is very high.""

And with even more rapid computerized trading technology just over the horizon and the increasing use of machine readable news, I don't think it really is a possibility - it is a certainty.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,,Impact - Raw,stock exchanges"
2010-10-01T07:00:00Z,Virgin Blue Sues Reservation & Ticketing System Developer for AU$20 Million, Goes after Accenture-owned Navitaire ,,,,,,,2.0E7,$,AUD,Australia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/aviation/virgin-blue-may-want-a20-million-for-reservation-system-meltdown,,Virgin Blue May Want $A20 Million For Reservation System Meltdown,"News reports coming out of Australia say that Virgin Blue estimates that the reservation system meltdown and resulting consequences has cost it up to $A20 million dollars.

The Australian reports Virgin Blue as saying:

""An initial assessment of this interruption shows an estimated pretax profit impact of $15 million - $20 million.""

The story goes on to say that the company will be ""actively pursuing all avenues to recover this cost.""

A major avenue of pursuit will be Accenture-owned Navitaire which supplies Virgin Blue its reservation and check-in system.

While Virgin Blue has been very vocal in its intention to pursue compensation, in Virginia, things have gone very quiet. As you may recall, in late August into early September, the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) suffered a server failure that knocked some 26 state agencies off-line for nearly a week. Northrop Grumman is the prime contractor responsible for providing IT services to the state.

At the time, there was much talk about sending a bill to Northrop Grumman for the cost of the outage. Samuel A. Nixon Jr., head of VITA, indicated that Northrop Grumman would face a fine of at least $100,000 for lost work and productivity, and Northrop Grumman did agree in mid-September to pay $250,000 towards a study of what went wrong and why.

But in late September, after an estimate of the outage cost to Virginia's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) alone came to some $1.2 million, talk of seeking compensation from Northrop Grumman has disappeared.

I wonder why.","Australia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,airport/port/customs/systems"

According to the NYSE:

""On Monday, October 18, the 4 pm ET closing auction in NYSE Arca primary listed symbols was delayed due to an issue with a software release, causing the auction cycle to run at 4:15 pm ET. These auction prices, occurring at 4:15 pm ET, constitute the official exchange closing prices for these issues, with the exception of ‘SPY.’ All trades in the closing auction in ‘SPY,’ which occurred at a price of $106.46, were ruled to be broken by NYSE Arca Market Management. The official closing price will be marked at [4:15 pm] utilizing the valid prior print of $118.28.""

The S&P index fund (SPY) affected has a market value of some $80 billion, Bloomberg says.

This latest problem comes on the heels of the report on the NYSE flash crash in May which was also traced to a software issue.

2010-11-01T07:00:00Z,Target Blames Computer Glitch for Short-changing Customers' Coupons, Unknown how much involved ,,,3,months,2160.0,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/target-blames-computer-for-shortchanging-customers,,Target Blames Computer For Short-Changing Customers,"Minneapolis-based Target Corporation is being accused of shortchanging its customers across the US by only partially crediting certain manufacturers' coupons at checkout time.

According to this story in the LA Times, some customers are finding that a coupon with a face value of $1.50 are being credited for only $1.02, while this blog at the Minneapolis StarTribune says that others who have redeemed $4.00 worth of coupons saw only $2.54 taken off.

Target, which operates 1,754 stores in 49 states, has known about this problem since August, the LA Times says. The Times also says the company, ""couldn't explain why the problem was happening or why it hadn't been resolved.""

Couldn't or wouldn't?

The Times quotes a Target spokesperson as saying:

""We are aware that some coupons are not scanning for the full amounts... We are aware of the issue and are diligently working on a fix for that and will implement it as soon as possible.""

Target blames the problem on some sort of computer glitch.

Reading through the various published articles on the issue, I gather that the issue arises most often - but not always - when a manufacturer's coupon requires the purchase of multiple items.

In addition, if the use of the coupon results in a price of less than zero, then the credit applied is the difference of the retail price and the coupon credit. So, if the coupon is for 50 cents, and the item costs 39 cents, the credit given is only 11 cents.

What is curious is why this problem all of the sudden showed up in August. It isn't like this is a brand new situation. The LA Times says that multi-item coupons make up about 25% of all manufacturers' coupons.

I suspect there was a computer system upgrade or maintenance fix in late July or early August that wasn't fully tested out.

The amount of money customers have been short-changed, and Target has kept, is likely not trivial, as Target gets reimbursed the face value of coupons its customers redeem.

Given the error is in Target's favor, one might be tempted to speculate that Target was in no hurry to fix the problem. With the national publicity now on the issue, that may now change.

According to the LA Times, Target isn't saying how much money is owed customers, nor has it made any mention of the issue on its web site that I can find. So much for being open and transparent about the problem to its customers.

If any of you have had problems at Target, let me know.

Verizon, in this press release, maintains the overcharges were ""inadvertent"" and that it was refunding the $50 million on its ""own initiative and because it is the right thing to do for our customers.""

Verizon also apologized and accepted responsibility for the billing error.

Of course, why it took Verizon two years to discover the problem even after numerous customer complaints, wasn't addressed in its press release.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,,Impact - Raw"
2010-11-01T07:00:00Z,"Portland, Oregon's Financial System Late and Over-budget", Original plan: $14 Million and 14-months to develop; actual $47 Million and 30-months ,,,,,,,4.7E7,$,USD,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/city-of-portland-financial-and-hrpayroll-project-overbudget-by-over-30-million,,"City of Portland Financial and HR/Payroll Project ""Over-budget"" by Over $30 Million","Last week, the Office of the City Auditor of Portland, Oregon, published an interesting report (here in PDF) regarding an originally planned $14 million, 14-month implementation SAP Financial and HR/Payroll system project that ended up costing the city some $47 million and taking 30-months instead.

In addition to being late and over-budget, the audit report also stated that when completed, the delivered system did not have all the functionality originally promised nor did the city eliminate nearly as many of the 200 identified shadow financial and HR/payroll-related IT systems as expected. Their elimination was touted as being one of the major benefits of (and justifications for) the new system.

The main reasons the auditors gave for the problems centered on poor project planning and inadequate leadership on the part of the City of Portland’s executive management from the beginning of the project. For example, the report noted that:

""When the project began, City managers based the initial budget of $14.2 million on an independent estimate to procure and implement an ERP system. The City later realized that the estimate did not include certain costs, such as computer hardware needed to support the new software and any City employee costs. However, we noted that the independent estimate clearly stated that it did not include these items.""

Thus, from the very start, ""over-budget"" and ""late"" were baked into the project's final outcome.

The project became later and more costly in some of the usual ways: for instance, the city was warned repeatedly from different sources that the 14-month project schedule they set in December 2006 was too aggressive, but those warnings were blithely ignored.

In addition, the original project functional requirements and their implementation implications and risks were not well thought out. As the report states:

""The project included designing a new accounting chart of accounts in order to improve consistency across the City for recording, tracking, and obtaining financial information. In order to convert financial data from the old software into the new SAP software, the City had to develop and program a crosswalk between the two charts of accounts. This process was more complex and time-consuming than expected.""

The original project development company - before it was fired and a new one hired (which added to the project's delay) - also apparently routinely agreed to city employee-suggested requirements changes without thinking through their impact on the development budget, schedule or system functionality. The development company, the auditors additionally noted, also lacked some necessary skills required to manage and implement the project they were contracted to deliver, which may explain why it helped torpedo its own contract.

Furthermore, project decision-making was decentralized because of the large number of stakeholders involved. The result?

""According to one City project leader, the project’s organizational structure caused more time to make a decision than if a single individual had decision-making authority.""

This could be seen, the report indicated, by the fact that the independent quality assurance (QA) contractor raised several ""red"" issues in its monthly reports - meaning they ""required the immediate attention of Executive management and the Project Manager"" - for months on end without any resolution.

However, the report also noted disagreement with the project leader's statement above. The report says that ""... the City’s Chief Administrative Officer has indicated that he had single decision-making authority for key issues.""

Given the project's outcome, I don't think I would be touting that fact too loudly.

Well, Portland's SAP Financial and HR/Payroll system is now delivered, although not everyone is happy with it. Turns out the employee training required for using the system wasn't all it could be either. The auditors recommended in their report that additional resources be budgeted to training City of Portland employees on the system.

One final note. The true cost of developing the system is at least $47 million, but its final cost will likely never be known. As the auditors state:

""The reported final project costs of $47.4 million do not include all project costs incurred by the City. Reported costs do not include the payroll and benefits costs for many city employees formally assigned to the project full-time and working at the project office. Reported costs also do not include most city personnel working part-time on the project.""

If I were a Portland taxpayer, I might be curious about exactly which government accounts those city employees working on the project actually charged their time against over the past couple of years. Might prove enlightening.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,ERP"

According to this story at Herald Sun, the unspecified mainframe computer glitch ""... meant payments into most National Australia Bank accounts - and services including EFTPOS and ATMs - were frozen and did not occur.""

[Update: A story in Friday morning's Sydney Morning Herald states that the outage ""... was caused by a corrupted file during the routine processing of overnight transactions on Wednesday. Sources inside the bank said the issue had affected all level of transactions, from retail to wholesale."" The story also says that the bank is now not promising when the problem will be totally fixed.]

In addition, the Herald Sun story says,

""The mainframe computer malfunction came on the worst day of the week for the National Australia Bank customers, the day when client payrolls are processed, as are millions of Centrelink payments.""

According to ABCNews in Australia,

""NAB says the payments will go through in full once the IT problem is fixed, and adds that customers will not be charged by the bank for slipping into negative balances or failing to make payments because it has already abolished dishonour fees.""

""However, the bank's statement does not say whether it will compensate customers who are charged late payment fees by third parties due to the payments glitch.""

The Herald Sun reports that the bank has some 11 million customers.

NAB Chief Executive Cameron Clyne was quoted as apologizing to the bank's customers for the inconvenience.

CEO Clyne also said,

""Unfortunately for a large organisation these things happen from time to time.""

What a refreshingly honest - if possibly impolitic - statement for a change. I wonder how soon CEO Clyne will be taken to task for it?

[Update2: A story dated Saturday, the 27th of November, in The Age says that NAB's problems have spread to other banks in Australia, including Commonwealth Bank, ANZ Bank, HSBC Bank and Citi. The story says ""... millions of Australians face the weekend without ability to access their funds or pay.""

The story says that NAB is now saying it may be early next week before the problems are totally fixed and all of its customers get access to their funds. In addition, it will be up to customers to notify NAB if anything is still awry with their accounts.

NAB in a press release says that it will be adding staff and keeping more of its branches open on Saturday to try to help customers who may be having financial difficulties as a result of the problems.]","Australia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,,Impact - Raw,banking"
2010-12-01T07:00:00Z,Comcast Suffers Major East Coast Outage Lasting for 12 Hours, Server issue blamed ,,,12,hours,12,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/telecom/internet/comcast-suffers-major-internet-outage,,Comcast Suffers Major Internet Outage,"The cable company Comcast suffered a major Internet outage affecting a large swath of the US East Coast from Virginia to New Hampshire last night from about 2020 to 1120 EST. The problem apparently involved Comcast's Domain Name Servers (DNS), according to Rob Pegoraro in his Fast Forward blog in the Washington Post.

This CNN story with a time stamp of 0246 today quotes a Comcast spokesperson as saying:

""Late this evening, our engineers identified a server issue that was affecting only Internet service in Greater Boston and DC/Beltway areas.""

The Comcast spokesperson could not say how many customers were affected, nor what the specific problem was with its servers. Engineers were still working the issue, he said.

Warning: rest of this blog post is a personal rant.

As of now - about 0430 EST - Comcast has still not officially said what exactly happened on its web site or the number of customers affected, and I have doubts that it ever will. Why? Just notice how the spokesperson's statement above tries to minimize the number of Comcast customers affected. However, news reports indicate Comcast customers in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, Washington DC, and Virginia were without service. That is a whole bunch of folks.

Furthermore, I don't think folks living in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine or Connecticut think they are part of the ""Great Boston"" area; and I am certainly not located in the DC/Beltway area in Virginia.

Comcast seems, like most companies nowadays, to have decided that by saying as little as possible about a major service disruption - especially on its web site - means that it never happened.

If I sound a bit irritated, it is because I am a worn-out Comcast Internet and cable customer (I was actually once a happy Adelphia customer who was taken over by Comcast - Adelphia had its problems, but nothing like that I routinely experience with Comcast).

Comcast customer service - which is often an oxymoron - basically melted down by 2100 EST, with an ""all circuits are busy"" message when you tried to call them. I first dialed in at 2029 EST, or about 9 minutes after the outage began, and the automated ""help"" system even then couldn't connect me to a live customer service representative.

Of course, the automated voice did helpfully say that I could check out Comcast's web site for further information and help.

If there is anything that is more moronic than an Internet service provider who you are calling inquiring about the lack of their Internet service sending you to the Internet and their web site for further assistance, I don't know what it is.

In addition, Comcast does not put automated messages when dialing its customer service line that an outage has occurred in your area. Adelphia used to do that. And no, sending messages out by Twitter that there may be a problem isn't an adequate substitute.

Good thing the outage hit last night instead of today - ""Cyber Monday.""

I know, I know. I should stop complaining and look around for a new Internet service provider if I don't like Comcast, but where I live the choices are pretty limited. However, I think this may be the last straw, especially now with Comcast buying NBC. I can't see Comcast putting any money - or maybe better said - having any money left to upgrade its Internet service reliability or its customer service, both of which are needed.

Anyone else wanting to vent about Comcast (or any other Internet provider for that matter), feel free. The blog line is now open.

And before I forget, Rob Pegoraro's blog has information and links on how to access the Internet when there is a similar type of Internet outage.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit"

The FiReControl project, which was to integrate 46 stand-alone fire department control rooms into 9 regional centers, was originally initiated in March 2004 and slated to be completed by November of 2007. The government promised at the time that it would use ""tried and tested"" technology to ensure that a rapid (and cost contained) implementation would ensue. That didn't happen, as costs have exploded from the original project estimate of £100 million to £423 million with a rollout beginning in 2011 and completing by the end of 2012.

Even though the Fire Services Minister admitted earlier this year that the project was bungled from the very start, the government decided to try to get it finished by next year anyway. It became increasingly obvious over the past few months that this was never going to happen, so the government and the prime contractor, EADS Defense & Security Division (now called Cassidian), reached a mutually satisfactory agreement to end the contract.

As explained by the Fire Minister Bob Neill,

""Following extensive discussion with Cassidian, we have jointly concluded, with regret, that the requirements of the project cannot be delivered to an acceptable timeframe... Therefore the best outcome for the taxpayer and the fire and rescue community is for the contract to be terminated with immediate effect.""

The Fire Minister refused to disclose, however, the compensation that the government has agreed to pay EADS for terminating the contract, citing ""commercial confidentiality.""

The government has already paid out some £230 million for the project and received virtually nothing for it. Labour MP John McDonnell, secretary of the Fire Brigades Union's parliamentary group, claims that as much as £1.3 billion may be closer to the true amount wasted in costs and lost staff morale reports the Yorkshire Post.

Ouch.

2010-12-01T07:00:00Z,New York City CityTime Project Riddled with Fraud, Original cost was $63-68 Million; latest cost to complete $722 Million; most of the increase is claimed to be fraudulent charges ,,,,,,,7.22E8,$,USD,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/nyc-bigtime-citytime-fraud-charges-ripples-on,,NYC BigTime CityTime Fraud Charges Ripples On,"Back in March, I blogged about New York City's CityTime project which according to New York City's Office of Payroll Administration (OPA): ...""is a secure, web-based time and attendance system for the 80 Mayoral and other Agencies of the City of New York.""

The project was initiated in 1998 at an estimated cost of $63 - 68 million, with the latest cost to complete being $722 million; some $670 million of that amount is slated for the defense contractor SAIC (Science Applications International Corp) for the system's development and management. The CityTime project was said to be only one-third complete in March of this year; it is now targeted for completion by June 2011.

Back in March, Mayor Michael Bloomberg called the project ""a disaster."" Now, apparently, he thinks it was an inevitability - though not, I assume, the rampant fraud that has been allegedly uncovered.



For on the 15th of December, the US Attorney Preet Bharara, Southern District of New York, charged ""four consultants to the New York City Office of Payroll Administration ... for operating a fraudulent scheme that led to the misappropriation of more than $80 million in New York City funds allocated for an information technology project known as 'CityTime.' ""

Three of the four consultants were also charged - along with one of the consultant's wife and mother - with using a network of shell corporations to launder the proceeds of the fraud. This one consultant, along with his wife and mother, are charged with embezzling some $25 million by themselves, the US Attorney's press release said (here in PDF).

The consultants' various lawyers say they are innocent of all the charges.

The consultants worked for a company called Spherion Staffing Services, which was to monitor the work of SAIC; Spherion was responsible for ""quality assurance"" on the project.

As a result of the arrests, New York City has suspended further payments to Spherion pending an audit.

The executive director of OPA, Joel Bondy, was then suspended without pay but shortly thereafter resigned his position. Mr. Bondy wrote glowing letters about the quality assurance work of Spherion, where he once worked. He also supposedly had ties to at least one of the consultants charged.

In March, OPA General Counsel Valerie Himelewski said that accusations at the time of flawed CityTime contract oversight were ""completely false"" - I wonder how much crow she ate for her holiday dinner this past weekend.

SAIC has also been smacked as a result of its CityTime contract management and oversight - or lack thereof. The City of New York decided to terminate a $40 million contract with SAIC to upgrade the Department of Sanitation's computer systems, one day after New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli Tuesday canceled SAIC's $118 million contract to upgrade the radio systems of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

Comptroller DiNapoli in his press release said that

""SAIC's role in the CityTime scandal in New York City remains unclear. There are indictments and very serious concerns about vendors involved on that project. In short, there are too many unanswered questions and too many public dollars at risk for this contract to go forward. New York can't afford another scandal like CityTime. I won't let the Transit Authority put $118 million on the table without the right kind of protections.""

Mayor Bloomberg, in the wake of the charges, admitted that the project had slipped ""through the cracks,"" but seemed to imply that it was just one of those things that happen in a city as large and complex as New York.

Further digging his own public relations hole deeper, Mayor Bloomberg then later tried to clarify the situation and place CityTime's problems in their proper perspective:

""Every big software project that I know, like the air-traffic controller system...these projects are so big, so complex. Maybe you can't do projects this big, but, anyways, this one we need desperately.""

The Mayor certainly does like comparing his CityTime payroll project to air traffic control system developments. Maybe Mayor Bloomberg would have been better to relate CityTime to the FBI's Virtual Case File System fiasco which SAIC also was responsible for developing.

The Mayor still claims that:

Lloyds Bank said that there was a ""technical error"" in their merchant system on the 31st of December, and that all the duplicated transactions have been corrected, according to this story at ComputerWorldUK.

However, since the error may have affected non-Lloyd bank customers as well, reversing duplicate transactions may not be the end of it. The reason is that some of those non-Lloyds Bank customers may have incurred penalties from their bank or credit/debit card holder for being ""over-drawn"" by the duplicated transaction. Those folks are going to have to contact Lloyds directly to get the issue straightened out.

Lloyds said in its statement quoted in this story at The Scotsman that:

""Cardholders who believe they have been financially penalised by their bank or card issuer as a direct result of the duplicated transactions are advised to contact us... We will consider all reasonable and evidenced requests for reimbursement.""

2011-01-01T07:00:00Z,SBINet Contract Terminated after $1 Billion Spent, Can't be made to work ,,,,,,,1.0E9,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,National,Customs,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/sbinet-officially-bites-the-dust,,SBInet Officially Bites the Dust,"Last Friday, as reported by various media outlets like Government Executive and Fierce GovernmentIT, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Janet Napolitano announced the termination of the long-brain dead but still on life-support virtual fence project called SBInet (Secure Border Initiative network).

The termination notice finally came after spending another $230 million or so on the effort while a Secretary Napolitano January 2010 ordered panel conducted over the past year a DHS-wide reassessment of the SBInet program ""that incorporated an independent, quantitative, science-based 'Analysis of Alternatives' to determine if SBInet is the most efficient, effective and economical way to meet our nation's border security needs.""

Now with over $1 billion spent on SBInet, the assessment panel came to the following conclusion (see PDF):

""Based on the assessment, the Department has concluded the SBInet program, as originally proposed, does not meet current standards for viability and cost-effectiveness. While it has generated some advances in technology that have improved Border Patrol agents’ ability to detect, identify, deter and respond to threats along the border, SBInet does not and cannot provide a single technological solution to border security.""

Have no fear, though:

""As a result, Secretary Napolitano has directed CBP [Customs and Border Protection] to end SBInet as originally conceived and instead utilize existing, proven technology solutions tailored to the distinct terrain and population density of each border region. This is a significant departure from the original SBInet concept of a single, one size fits all integrated fixed tower-based solution across the entire border.""

Of course, when the SBInet contract was originally let to Boeing in September 2006, Boeing promised that it would use ""proven, low risk, off-the-shelf technology,"" too.

What is going to happen instead of SBInet? Well, a sort of Son of SBInet:

""DHS is currently developing a comprehensive border technology deployment plan that will build upon successful technology currently deployed and provide the optimum mix of proven surveillance technologies by sector. Where appropriate, this technology plan will also include elements of the former SBInet program that have proven successful.""

This ""new way forward,"" DHS says, ""is expected to cost less than $750 million and will cover the rest of the Arizona border - totaling 323 miles."" SBInet only covered 53 miles.

Anyone want to bet that the ""expected cost"" and the final cost of SoSBInet will be less than $750 million?

It will take a while before the SoSBInet is deployed, since DHS plans to hold an open competition to acquire all the technologies needed. Before that can occur, however, more ""independent, quantitative, science-based assessments"" are needed to be performed.

Here's hoping that the acquisition process used by DHS will also use ""independent, quantitative, science-based assessments"" as well. SBInet's acquisition strategy and process was botched from the beginning, (see PDF) which started the program on its long and costly death spiral.","US,Project Failure,Government,National,Customs,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,airport/port/customs/systems"
2011-02-01T07:00:00Z,Allied Irish Banks Sues for €84 Million over Botched Retail Banking System, Suit brought against Oracle ,,,,,,,8.4E7,€,EUR,Ireland,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/allied-irish-banks-wants-84-million-from-two-oracle-companies-for-botched-retail-banking-system,,Allied Irish Banks Wants €84M for Botched Retail Banking System,"The Irish Times this week ran an article about the lawsuit brought by Allied Irish Banks (AIB) against Oracle Financial Services Software BV (OFSSBV) and Oracle Financial Services Software Ltd (OFSS Ltd) for allegedly botching a retail banking system implementation. The former is based in the Netherlands, while the latter is based in Germany.

According to the Times article, ""AIB is suing OFSS BV as alleged provider of the software and OFSS Ltd in its capacity as alleged guarantor of the obligations of its related company.""

AIB claims that it ""wasted"" €84 million on a new retail banking system using a platform called Flexcube, developed by Oracle Financial Services Software (there is a bit of tangled history about the development of Flexcube and its eventual relationship to Oracle, which interested Risk Factor readers can read about here).

This 2007 story that appears to be a press release says that Flexcube would enable AIB ""to implement a common IT operating model for retail banking [across the UK and Ireland]... AIB says the technology will provide a new streamlined and efficient method of handling customer data.""

In addition, the 2007 story quotes a Maura McEvilly, who was the head of enterprise core retail banking at AIB, as saying:

""This [Flexcube] will deliver enhanced services to our customers and help us grow and develop our business.""

Well, apparently it did not.

The Irish Times story says that AIB claims that the Flexcube platform was ""beset with technical problems"" as well as project management issues which resulted in only 3,000 out of an expected and agreed 5,000,000 customer retail accounts being switched over to the platform between March 2007 to March 2010. AIB stopped working on further customer switch overs at the end of March 2010.

AIB wants not only €84 million, the Irish Times article reports, but also unspecified ""damages for loss of profits and damage to goodwill.""

The Irish Times article provides a decent overview over why the project seemed to go sour, but this article at IBS Intelligence provides additional details and links to useful background articles.

An article in India Info Line (IIFL) states that the shares in Oracle Financial Services Software fell on the news of the AIB lawsuit. It also reports that the company will be filing counter-claims ""... against AIB for breach of contract and outstanding fees.""

Speaking of sour, that's definitely the taste in SAP's and consulting company Deloitte Consulting LLP's mouths. As I noted last June, Marin County, California decided to sue Deloitte for $30 million over what it said was a botched SAP implementation. The suit was originally filed in Marin County Superior Court but was recently moved to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, i..e, a federal district court.

A story Wednesday at ComputerWorld says that Marin County is not only suing Deloitte, but now also SAP America, Inc. and SAP Public Services, Inc. and a former Marin County employee, then County Assistant Auditor-Controller Ernest Culver.

The County alleges (see this press release in PDF here) that:

""Deloitte Consulting LLP, a U.S. subsidiary of global consulting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and two U.S. subsidiaries of the German enterprise resource software developer SAP AG (SAP America, Inc. and SAP Public Services, Inc.), engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity designed to defraud the County of more than $20 million.""

Federal racketeering charges? That's kicking it up a notch. Even the New York City CityTime fiasco with its $80 million in alleged fraud didn't bring racketeering charges.

The outcome of this case could get very, very interesting, especially to other US state and local government organizations who may believe their consultants and/or product vendors are ripping them off.

The County says that:

""The complaint alleges that as part of the scheme, Deloitte falsely represented that it had the necessary skills to implement SAP for Public Sector software, and that the SAP entities falsely vouched for Deloitte’s skills. In fact, the complaint alleges, Deloitte’s consultants lacked the requisite skills, and, when problems with Deloitte’s work began to surface, Deloitte and the SAP entities engaged in a cover-up that included bribing Culver to falsely 'approve' Deloitte’s defective work, and silencing an SAP employee who attempted to intervene on the County’s behalf.""

Marin County now wants $35 million, which would be tripled under the Federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statute, as well as punitive damages.

Deloitte, the ComputerWorld story says, calls the lawsuit ""a frivolous litigation tactic."" SAP is refusing to comment.

Finally, this blog post at The Red Tape Chronicles says that AT&T is facing a class action lawsuit from iPhone users who claim AT&T's billing system is overcharging them.

The post says that the lawsuit, also filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that AT&T's billing software is over-stating data downloads by 7% to 14% as well as showing data downloads even when iPhones are turned off.

AT&T says that its billing system is accurate, and will vigorously defend itself in court.","Ireland,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,banking"

As a result, ""common-factor risks were significantly underrepresented.""

The error, which was discovered in later June 2009 wasn't corrected until between September and mid-November 2009. The error actually was introduced into the company's risk model in early 2007, and led to investors losing a total of $217 million.

However, according to the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), after the error was discovered in June 2009:

""Instead of disclosing and fixing the error immediately, senior ARG [AXA Rosenberg Group LLC] and BRRC [Barr Rosenberg Research Center LLC] officials directed others to keep quiet about the error and declined to fix the error at that time.""

According to this report last July at APBankers, the founder of AXA Rosenberg, Barr Rosenberg, and Tom Mead, director of research, resigned because of their role in the affair. Proves again the old maxim that the cover-up is as bad if not worse than the error.

The SEC found such actions constituted fraud, and in a settlement agreement with AXA, fined the company $25 million. The company, which neither admitted or denied the SEC findings, also agreed to pay $217 million to investors. Furthermore, the company agreed to hire ""... an independent consultant with expertise in quantitative investment techniques who will review disclosures and enhance the role of compliance personnel.""

This may not be the end of it, though.

For on the 15th of February, reports the Financial Times of London:

""... the closing auction on Tuesday began 42 seconds later than its normal start of 4.30pm. The auction normally lasts five minutes and is designed to help set a definitive closing price for stocks at the end of the day, which helps asset managers with portfolio reconciliation and valuation.""

""The effect was to confuse computer algorithms, triggering trades at the wrong time, sparking volatility, some market participants said.""

This time, it caused trading to be suspended for some 4 hours.

According to this morning story at the London Telegraph, trading was halted a few minutes after the market opened at 0800 London time. The market then reopened at 1215, this afternoon Telegraph story reports.

This is the second major problem with the LSE's new trading system since it was made officially operational on the 14th of February. The previous incident happened on the 15th of February. The Telegraph afternoon's article says that the LSE blamed the problem on a ""real time data dissemination issue.""

Traders were naturally irritated with this latest gaffe.

This is also the second time this week that LSE executive management was embarrassed by the poor performance of its trading operations. As the Telegraph notes:

""On Tuesday, Borsa Italiana, a unit of LSE, suspended trading for six-and-a-half hours because of a technical glitch a day after a day after the country’s benchmark FTSE MIB Index [see PDF on FTSE MIB Index here] plunged amid concern about unrest in Libya.""

The technical glitch was attributed by Borsa Italiana as ""a technical issue on DDMPlus, real time data feed service used by the majority of domestic operators.""

The problem first arose about 30 minutes before ASX officials decided a fix wasn't forthcoming and the exchange had to be completely shut down. The ASX normally closes at 1600.

According to this story at the Sydney Morning Herald, an exchange official said they did not yet know if it was a hardware or software issue that was causing the problem. In addition, ASX did not know if the problem would be fixed in time for Tuesday morning trading, although all trades made before the stoppage on Monday would be honored.

The Herald reported that the closure, given past average trading volumes, meant about A$1.5 billion in trading was likely lost, as well.

The ASX adopted the Nasdaq Genium INET trading platform (see PDF here) last November. At least the ASX was able to operate a few months with their new trading system before having a problem, unlike the LSE.

Chris Munoz of the 506 Parachute Infantry Regiment uses a manpack radio while on patrol in the vicinity of Baqer Kheyl, Paktika, eastern Afghanistan, on April 8, 2011.

As several dozen soldiers from the U.S. Army’s Task Force Rock drove into Afghanistan’s Chowkay Valley one morning in March 2010, Taliban fighters immediately began moving into ambush positions along a higher ridge. The Force’s mission was to protect a U.S. reconstruction team as it met with local village leaders, but it was stuck in place as the Taliban reached their fighting posts.

What tied them down was their radios: a forest of plastic and metal cubes sprouting antennae of different lengths and sizes. They had short-range models for talking with the reconstruction team; longer-range versions for reaching headquarters 25 miles away; and a backup satellite radio in case the mountains blocked the transmission. An Air Force controller carried his own radio for talking to jet fighters overhead and a separate radio for downloading streaming video from the aircraft.

Some of these radios worked only while the troopers were stationary; others were simply too cumbersome to operate on the move. “Not good,” said Spec. Geoff Pearman, as he watched farmers scurry indoors from their wheat fields — a sure sign that fighting was imminent.

Task Force Rock’s vulnerability that morning is routine for U.S. forces in Afghanistan today. But it was never supposed to occur at all.

Almost fifteen years ago, the Army launched an ambitious program, the Joint Tactical Radio System, aimed at developing several highly-compatible “universal” radios. Together, the JTRS radios would replace nearly all older radios in the American arsenal, greatly simplifying communications and freeing up combat units “to tap into the network on the move,” according to Paul Mehney, an Army spokesman.

But JTRS, pronounced “jitters,” failed to live up to its promise. Overly ambitious, poorly managed and saddled by incompatible goals, the program burned through $6 billion dollars while producing little working hardware. Delays forced the Army to spend $11 billion more on old-style radios to meet the urgent demands of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

The Army eventually reduced the planned purchase of JTRS radios and cut the types of radios in development. In October, it canceled the vehicle-mounted version of JTRS, the most important of the new radios, which by then had grown to the size of a dormitory-sized refrigerator. For all practical purposes, JTRS is dead — at least in its original guise.

But the need for simpler battlefield communications remains. After an investment of 15 years and $17 billion, today the Army is still struggling to build better radios and estimates it may need to spend another $12 billion to get what it needs. The U.S. taxpayer has paid the bill, but frontline soldiers like those from Task Force Rock bear the true cost.

JTRS’ history is one of grand but naive technological ambition colliding with the unbending laws of physics and the unforgiving exigencies of modern warfare. After years of work, the Army discovered for itself what experts had been warning all along: It’s impossible for a single radio design to handle all the military’s different communications tasks.

The more capabilities that the Army and prime contractor Boeing packed into JTRS, the bigger, more complex and more expensive it became — until it was too bulky and unreliable for combat. In its relentless drive for conceptual simplicity, the Army found itself mired in mechanical complexity.

The Army wasn’t alone in its doomed pursuit of a technological pipe dream. The past decade has by many accounts been an era of grand ambition, flawed management and wasted treasure for all the military branches. A lengthy Harvard Business School study for the Pentagon concluded in April that despite many attempts at reform, “major defense programs still require more than 15 years to deliver less capability than planned, often at two to three times the planned cost.”

But the Army has arguably had more failures than other services. An internal report in 2010 noted that every year since 1996, the Army has spent more than a billion dollars annually “on programs that were ultimately cancelled” – including 15 cancelled since 2001. More than a third of its weapons development funds over the past seven years were spent on weapons systems deemed unusable in the end.

“I feel sorry for the Army,” said Thomas Christie, the Pentagon’s top weapons tester from 2001 to 2005. “Everything they’ve touched has turned to crap.”

Now the Pentagon faces a round of budget-cutting. So if the Army is to acquire new radios to keep its forces moving, it must do so on the cheap. That means reforming the vast, slow-moving bureaucracy entrusted to developing, testing and buying new military gear — a goal the Army is finally taking steps to reach. But it also means separating the good ideas from the bad ones at the outset, an ability that independent experts say continues to elude the world’s most powerful ground fighting force.

A Program Born in Frustration

The Army’s latest plan for overhauling its battlefield communication system was forged after the ground war to liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi Army in February 1991. While preparing for the lightning Left Hook drive north and east in southern Iraq, Pentagon planners were frustrated by their need to decide everything in advance because of the Army’s inability to communicate well on the move.

They developed a plan to create a “cyberwar” force on the battlefield, upending a tradition that only leaders carry radios, and information flows not between individuals, but between squads, platoons, companies, and other units. Instead of merely pointing their rifles and scanning with their eyes, every soldier in the networked force would be an information node with his own cameras, GPS tracker and radio, all communicating perfectly with others.

The Army formally started the program in 1997, calling it the “Joint Tactical Radio.” The JTR — the “S” for “System” was soon added — was to be compatible with all previous Army radio models plus almost every radio used by the Marines, Air Force, Navy and even civilian organizations such as local police departments.

The architecture was meant to be flexible, matching the communications needs of every imaginable user, from an individual private soldier lugging a rifle across the battlefield to top generals in their high-tech headquarters deep inside friendly territory. JTRS would even work in space.

The new radio, moreover, was a key component of an even more ambitious program — a collection of new lightweight armored vehicles and weapons-carrying robots collectively known as the Future Combat Systems. They would be fast-moving, widely-spread and plugged into a vast information network. Each would carry its own JTRS radio, as would every soldier riding inside.

After a series of war games to refine the cyberwar concept, in June 2000 the Defense Department awarded Chicago-based Boeing, America’s number-two defense contractor after Lockheed Martin, a $2-million contract to begin preparing JTRS blueprints. By Pentagon standards, it was a tiny contract. The overall JTRS program, including design and production, was expected to cost at least $6 billion over the first 10 years — and up to $40 billion by the time every last JTRS radio was bought, many years later.

For Boeing, that first contract was a foot in the door for both JTRS and Future Combat Systems, which by itself was expected to cost at least $120 billion over a period of decades. Boeing was not an experienced radio maker, nor did it manufacture armored vehicles. But the company sold itself to the Army on the strength of its intellectual prowess and management skills, stressing in a press release its “proven experience in large-scale system design, development and deployment.”

A little over a year later, 9/11 opened the floodgates for defense spending. After a series of high-level Pentagon meetings in 2002, the Army got a green light to give Boeing the major contracts for both JTRS and Future Combat Systems. Under the latter contract, Boeing was to receive 10 to 15 percent profit margins, regardless of the program’s success or eventual cost.

During the review, Christie, the Pentagon’s top weapons tester, warned top officials that the Army’s plans were unrealistic. “I said there’s no way this is going to happen,” he recalls. “But they got the go-ahead anyway, by claiming there was little technical risk.”

One Size Does Not Fit All

The Army figured it would need 230,000 copies of the main JTRS radios to replace 750,000 of its older radios and lighten unit commanders’ loads. The other military branches together would buy another 90,000 or so radios, and they would all connect with a quarter-million related devices. The new radios had to be phased in gradually due to manufacturing constraints, which meant each JTRS radio had to be compatible not only with other JTRS radios and the radios belonging to the other armed services, but also with all the Army’s old-style radios.

Achieving such broad compatibility posed a daunting challenge. Traditionally, the size and shape of military radios is determined by their task. A vehicle-mounted radio piping in data from some distant headquarters is large enough to accommodate a larger antenna, more processing power and more sophisticated encryption. A radio for an infantry squad is small enough for one man to carry; it has less range, power and encryption.

In addition, radios must be equipped to interpret particular radio “languages” known as a “waveforms,” tailored for specific types of transmissions. Some are better for moving data; others are better for voice or a mix of data and voice. The Army wanted JTRS to be compatible with the 30 or so most important military waveforms, including several ideally suited for the new radios. But it gradually grasped that it was impossible for a single radio design to handle all tasks and all waveforms.

“There’s no one-size-fits-all,” admits Brig. Gen. Michael Williamson, who since March has overseen the rapidly fading JTRS program. So JTRS split into several sub-programs between 2000 and 2004, each developing a different version. Boeing handled the bulk of the work in California and Missouri, but other defense contractors – including BAE Sytems in New Jersey and Rockwell Collins in Iowa -- got slices, as well. There were sea-, air- and space-based versions.

The ground-combat branch settled on one major JTRS radio, the so-called “Ground Mobile Radio” meant for vehicles, plus a smaller version for small units marching on foot, and the handheld version for individual soldiers. The ground radio was the main focus, a key to getting Army units talking on the move to each other, to aircraft overhead, to the Navy offshore and to senior commanders far away.

“JTRS would largely lift the fog of war,” Loren Thompson, an analyst with the Lexington Institute in Virginia, crowed on his blog in December 2010. The Lexington Institute receives funding from Boeing and other military contractors, and Thompson now describes JTRS as “a mixed bag.”

JTRS’ collapse began when reality intervened, after unit commanders in the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq struggled to stay in contact while on the move. Just as the Army’s war needs expanded the demand for innovation, software problems with the new radios slowed testing. So the Army had no choice but to buy non-JTRS radios from other manufacturers -- 300,000 radios in all, worth nearly $11 billion through 2006.

Frustrated by the delays and freshly equipped with new copies of old-style radios, the Army began losing its appetite for JTRS. Between 2006 and 2008, the Army scaled back its JTRS purchasing plans by 20 percent and decided the new radio would understand just eight waveforms instead of 33.

The reductions shaved billions of dollars off the cost of developing JTRS, but also increased the overall pricetag for each one, including research and development expenses. The Army suddenly expected to pay up to $300,000 for each JTRS ground radio — roughly double its estimate in 2002. By comparison, a factory-fresh, vehicle-mounted, non-JTRS radio from another major military supplier, the Harris Corp., costs just $57,000.

Technical Problems Worsen

The technical challenges of transmitting huge amounts of data over complex new waveforms became so acute that in 2005, the Army briefly ordered Boeing to stop work on JTRS. But the Pentagon has a hard time cancelling any program – often because the contracts it signs impose steep penalties on the government for any major change of heart -- and so the Army decided to reorganize the management office while allowing Boeing to proceed.

The program did not improve. Col. Dan Hughes, who oversaw ground radio development between 2006 and 2009, watched the radio grow in complexity and cost, while continually missing design deadlines. “We tried to make it better and better and better,” he says. But in the first two years after full-scale development was approved, the number of pages in the blueprint for the ground radio design tripled, according to a Government Accountability Office report in 2005. The radio also tipped the scales at 207 pounds — several times the weight of existing radios.

Plans to hand over prototypes to the troops for realistic testing got bumped back one year, then two, then three. With each delay, the Army was forced to buy more old-style radios for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Manufacturers took the opportunity to upgrade their existing radio designs with enhanced processors, software and encryption and new waveforms, bringing them closer to the ground radio’s specs.

The Harris firm tweaked one of its popular radios to accommodate the main JTRS waveforms, and quickly sold 16,000 of the new radios, mostly to the Army.

Then, in 2010, the Army assembled 1,000 battlefield veterans at a desert training range at Fort Bliss, just outside of El Paso, to try out the key bits of JTRS technology. They criticized its size, its weight, its short range and its tendency to break down. Michael Gilmore, the Army’s top weapons tester, cited the soldiers’ complaints in testimony before the House Armed Services Committee. He said the ground radio “demonstrated little military utility.”

Meanwhile, the federal government’s ballooning deficits prompted several rounds of defense cuts that shaved billions from the Army’s research and development accounts. Future Combat Systems was killed first, around the same time the evaluation troops were testing JTRS.

In October, the Army also canceled the ground radio. “The technical challenges of mobile, ad hoc networks and scalability were not well understood due to the immaturity of technology at that time,” Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall explained in letters to the chairmen of the congressional armed services committees, Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Rep. Howard McKeon (R-Cal.)..

Aspects of the overall JTRS program survive. The two main JTRS waveforms are still in development. So are the air-, sea- and space-based versions of the radio, plus some of the smaller Army models — in particular, the soldiers’ hand-held version. “We don’t want more monolithic programs,” says Col. John Morrison, who oversees the Army’s network-based battle-command efforts. Under the best of circumstances, the GAO estimates, the radios will cost another $12 billion to complete.

Although the Pentagon sometimes tries to recoup money invested in failed weapons, in the case of the ground radio, the Army said it would simply allow the Boeing contract, which was good through 2012, to lapse. Boeing would not be paid to continue ground-radio work — nor would the company be penalized.

A spokesman for Boeing, Matthew Billingsley, declined to say if the nonpublic contract allowed for the company to be penalized. He said that Boeing was disappointed at the program’s cancellation, and that the company looked forward to “applying our experience and knowledge in future competitions.”

Task Force Rock, anchored to the floor of Afghanistan’s Chowkay Valley by its radios in March 2010, was lucky. It escaped an attack by fleeing the valley under the cover of U.S. helicopters firing white phosphorus rockets. Burdened with radios the Army has spent more than 20 years trying to replace, other American combat units might not be so lucky.","US,Project Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Contract termination/cancellation"
2011-03-01T07:00:00Z,Computer Problems at Japan's Mizuho Bank Continued into Second Week," Millions of financial transactions delayed for processing for a week, ATMs closed for 3 days ",,,1,weeks,168.0,1000000,,,,Japan,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/japans-mizuho-bank-computer-problems-persist-in-second-week,,Japan's Mizuho Bank Computer Problems Persist into Second Week,"Last Tuesday, Japan's Mizuho Bank, the country's third largest by market capitalization, began experiencing problems with its internal computer systems. ATMs malfunctioned and bank deposits could not be processed, which meant salaries for workers of employers which used the bank couldn't be paid. Foreign exchange transactions also stopped.

The bank's outages increased the already high stress levels of its Japanese customers, who were already trying to cope with the aftermath of the earthquake, tsunami, and word of radiation problems at a Japanese nuclear power facility.

At first blush, it was assumed that the bank's IT problems were associated with the earthquake and subsequent power outages, but the bank said they were not. However, Mizuho also admitted on Wednesday that it didn't completely understand the cause of the problems, the Wall Street Journal reported. It suspected the problems were tied to an increase in bank transactions by its customers.

On Thursday, the bank was able to restart its ATM system. By then, some 440,000 transactions valued at 570 billion yen ($7.2 billion) had not been processed, reported this Bloomberg story.

On Friday, the situation wasn't much better. The bank still did not know exactly what had caused the system malfunctions, although Mizuho believed that it was a surge in direct deposit transactions at some branch offices in Tokyo, this story at NIKKEI.com reported. The story reports that the bank stated that ""about 620,000 salary payment transactions worth Y125.6 billion weren't processed Friday.""

The bank also decided on Friday to bring down all of its 38,000 ATM machines for the next three days in order to restore its banking systems. About 1 million ATM users were estimated to be affected by the shut-down

On Sunday, NIKKEI.com reported that Mizuho Bank executives announced that the banking problems would persist until at least Tuesday. In the NIKKEI.com article, the bank seemed positive that its IT problems did indeed have its roots in the surge in customer direct deposits. NEKKEI.com also reported that by Sunday:

""The lender's system glitch ... [has] affected more than 1 million cash transfer orders worth about Y830 billion ($10.3 billion) so far.""

""270,000 transactions that were placed at the bank earlier this week, were processed, but 890,000 transactions including salary payments have been not yet processed.""

There are now stories today (here and here) at the Wall Street Journal that ""... about 3,500 of its ATMs at 440 branches will be functioning from Tuesday morning for cash deposits and withdrawals ... But ATMs outside its branches will remain closed.""

The WSJ also reports that Japan's Financial Services Agency is considering ""disciplining"" Mizuho Bank for its on-going technological problems.

The WSJ goes on to state that:

""On Sunday, Mizuho had operational-level talks with its archrivals, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, the core banking unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, over how they could help Mizuho with transaction settlements, in case Mizuho's troubles drag on, another person familiar with the matter said. Underscoring the gravity of the situation, the FSA has asked Mizuho's rivals to help it through this crisis.""

The problem with this approach is to make sure that if the two other Japanese banks process some of Mizuho's transactions, the added load doesn't take down those banking systems as an unintended consequence.

I recall hearing one Japanese resident saying during a TV interview last week that the lesson to be learned is always to have a cash reserve at home in case of an emergency.

Worth remembering, I think.","Japan,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,banking"
2011-03-01T07:00:00Z,Victoria Police AU$59 Million Link Crime Database Project Canceled After Costs Soar to At Least AU$187 Million,  AU$100 Million shortfall discovered in January 2011 ,,,,,,,1.0E8,$,AUD,Australia,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/police-database-would-have-cut-crime-20110420-1doxp.html,,Police database 'would have cut crime',"THE proposed new Victoria Police crime database - which has been shelved by the Baillieu government due to soaring costs - would have cut crime and generated up to $258 million in benefits, according to the original business plan for the system.

Police stopped the LINK database project yesterday, admitting they had underestimated its cost by at least $100 million, after the government demanded a second business case to justify the extra funding.

Police Minister Peter Ryan said police would not get ''another cent'' for the new system until the government knew where taxpayers' money had been spent.

The 2006 business case for the system, obtained by The Age under freedom of information, and which was put to the then Bracks Labor government, said the LINK system would generate a likely economic benefit of between $172 million and $258 million by reducing crime.

But the bid also acknowledged there was ''medium'' risk of the project being delivered late or not at all, and that it would cost more than the original $59 million budgeted.

In a section entitled ''risk analysis and management'', the business case lists project management, security and projects costs as the most serious risks and noted: ''Inadequate project management is a common cause of project failure and a major contributor to the fact that 60-70 per cent of IT-related projects fail to deliver the target benefits.''

Police Commissioner Simon Overland yesterday conceded the original business case was flawed. ''Clearly, we didn't get it right,'' he said.

Mr Overland said police would have to provide a ''very, very robust'' case that spells out why the extra money is needed and gives the government confidence it will be delivered on budget and on time if LINK goes ahead.

Though the new system was meant to be operating last year, the old system - which was plagued by scandals including the release of confidential files - will now operate for at least another three years.

Mr Ryan said a decision on whether to fund LINK would also take into account the recommendations of a joint investigation by the Ombudsman and Auditor-General - revealed by The Age - into cost blowouts in IT projects.

''Unlike the former Labor government, we are not going to have more money poured into this project, which is akin to tipping water down a well,'' he said.

Victoria Police suspended the LINK project in March last year due to cost blowouts and delays. A report recommending that suspension to Mr Overland, also obtained by The Age, canvassed but rejected scrapping the project.

The $100 million shortfall was then revealed in a January report to police by KPMG. That report cost police $250,000, with a second technical report costing $175,000. The KPMG report reveals that the cost of developing interfaces between the new system and other agencies the force shares information with was underestimated by up to $30 million. Training costs were underestimated by the same amount, according to the report, but were later put at $25 million.

Deputy Commissioner Kieran Walshe said Victoria Police, in its original business case, did not account for the cost of connecting LINK to other state government agencies such as VicRoads.","Australia,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"
2011-04-01T07:00:00Z,Georgian Woman Accused of Accidentally Bringing Down Armenia's Internet with Shovel, 75-year old likely scavenging for wiring to sell as scrap ,,,12,hours,12,,,,,Georgia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/telecom/internet/georgian-woman-accidentally-brings-down-armenias-internet,,Georgian Woman Accidentally Brings Down Armenia's Internet,"Who needs to conduct a sophisticated cyber attack to bring down a country's Internet service when all you need is a shovel?

There were news stories this week in the London Guardian and the Wall Street Journal (here and here) regarding a 75-year old Georgian woman by the name of Aishtan Shakarian who was scavenging for copper accidentally damaged with her shovel the international fiber-optic cable carrying 90% of Armenia's Internet traffic. While some Armenian telecom companies were able to switch to connections running through Iran, most of the 3.2 million citizens of Armenia were without Internet service for up to 12 hours, as were some portions of Georgia and Azerbaijan.

According to the Wall Street Journal:

""The Georgia section of the international cable, commonly called the country's West East fiber-optic backbone, is laid underground along railway tracks and operated by Georgia's state railway company and its partners. The line comes to Georgia from Bulgaria, crossing the Black Sea to the Georgian port of Poti. It later forks into Armenia and Azerbaijan.""

The cable is supposed to be heavily protected, says the Guardian article, but ""landslides or heavy rain may have exposed it to scavengers,"" it reports. When Ms. Shakarian, dubbed the ""the spade-hacker"" by the local media, cut into the cable, she set off alarms signals which helped police locate her. Ms. Shakarian was arrested, but a severe jail sentence is unlikely given her age, the stories say.

In 2008, submarine cables off Egypt were damaged twice (see here and here) which disrupted Internet, data and telephone communications across Europe and the Middle East. Also in 2008, a backhoe operator severed a fiber-optic cable causing a major land line, mobile phone and Internet shutdown for more than one million people in Queensland and Northern New South Wales, Australia.

Update 14 Apr 2011

Not much new about this incident, but there is this a story here from earlier this week published by the Sydney Morning Herald that states the woman, Aishtan Shakarian, who is accused of damaging the fiber-optic cable, denies doing it. Ms. Shakarian is quoted as saying that she isn't strong enough to have damaged the cable:

""I did not cut this cable. Physically, I could not do it.""

The Morning-Herald says that the Georgian Interior Ministry notes that all claims of innocence aside, Ms. Shakarian ""has already confessed to cutting the cable.""

The Herald also states that "".. Georgian Railway Telecom insists that the 600-kilometre cable has 'robust protection' ...""","Georgia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Retail,,Impact - Raw"
2011-04-01T07:00:00Z,National Australia Bank Suffers Another Computer Problem, Millions of Australians affected again ,,,1,days,24.0,,,,,Australia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/national-australia-bank-it-problems-affects-millions-again,,National Australia Bank IT Problems Affect Millions,"Last November, National Australia Bank (NAB) suffered a massive IT meltdown that kept customers from accessing their accounts and which took it months to fully straighten out. Then in January of this year - and while still suffering lingering customer account issues from the November fiasco - NAB experienced another IT glitch that took out NAB's online and telephone banking systems for a day.

During the January glitch, a NAB spokesperson said that, ""It's unfortunate but these things happen from time to time.""

Well, apparently it was time for yet another one of those ""unfortunate things"" to happen to NAB's IT department.

News reports out of Australia like this one at The Australian state that an IT system problem reminiscent of NAB's November crash hit the bank again today.

According to the paper, the IT problems affected NAB's Thursday's overnight processing of employer payrolls and some other financial transactions. The glitch not only impacted NAB's customers, but also the customers of banks that use NAB's processing services. These banks, the paper said, included ""Macquarie Bank, HSBC, Citibank, Bank of Scotland and UBS."" Some customers of Westpac, ANZ Bank and Commonwealth Bank were also reported to be impacted.

Overall, millions of people across Australia were likely affected by today's IT problems, The Australian article said.

NAB put out the perfunctory ""sorry for the inconvenience"" statement and promises in this Friday night (Australian time) press release that banking should be back to normal by tomorrow. NAB customers may be a bit skeptical of the bank's promise, however, since they heard the same refrain last November which turned out to be more than a wee bit optimistic.

And in other Australian-bank related news, you may have remembered that in early March, a ""routine database maintenance"" problem caused Commonwealth Bank's ATMs to spit out what the social medial rumor mill called ""free money"" for a good part of a day. Of course, it wasn't free. The bank decided that rather than shut down its ATM network because of the computer glitch, it would instead place its ATMs into ""standby mode"" which would allow the ATMs to still operate; however, customers would not be able to check their account balances.

In addition, standby mode would also allow customers to withdraw from the bank's ATMs more money than the customers actually had in their accounts.

Commonwealth Bank executives apparently figured that some small number of customers would accidentally overdraw their accounts, but they were seemingly shocked when large numbers of people decided that they would do so on purpose.

The bank sternly warned at the time that it would go after anyone who overdrew their bank accounts if they did not voluntarily and quickly pay the excess monies back.

Well, true to its word, about 10 days or so ago Commonwealth Bank sent ""threatening letters"" to those who failed to repay their ATM overdrafts. In addition, the bank decided that other ATM offenders should have their bank accounts frozen or closed altogether, while for over 100 of its account holders, the bank decided to refer them to the Australian police for possible prosecution. This approach in turn has caused a row to erupt in Australia over what ABCNews calls Commonwealth Bank's ""heavy-handed tactics.""

So far, Commonwealth Bank is saying it will not waiver from its stance of getting all of its money back. It probably will get most of it back in the end, but not without suffering yet another self-inflicted public relations black-eye.","Australia,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,,Impact - Raw,banking"
2011-04-01T07:00:00Z,Korea's NH Bank Computers Crash, 30 Million account holders  affected for days ,,,10,days,240.0,3.0E7,,,,Korea,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/south-korean-banks-weeklong-system-failure-affecting-30-million-an-inside-job,,South Korean NH Bank's Week-Long System Failure That Affected 30 Million An Inside Job?,"This post is about an on-going IT whodunit.

Late afternoon last Tuesday, South Korea's National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, aka Nonghyup or NH Bank, experienced a system-wide crash that halted all of its banking transactions at 1710 local time. According to various Korean news reports, customers were unable to make ATM deposits or withdrawals, nor conduct any on-line or phone banking, or make use of in-bank deposit or withdrawal services. Some 30 million account holders of the bank - which owns the largest banking network in South Korea - were affected by the massive outage.

Partial services - including the use of ATMs along with Internet and phone banking - were reportedly ""restored"" by Wednesday afternoon. NH bank said that while it wasn't exactly sure of what the problem was, it wasn't caused by outside hacking as in the case of Hyundai Capital. The bank did pinpoint the problem to ""an IBM transmission server at a computing center in southern Seoul,"" this article last Thursday morning in Joongang Daily stated.

By Thursday afternoon, however, NH Bank still hadn't been able to restore credit card and check card services, according to this story by the Yonhap News Agency. The article also reported that the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office and the Financial Supervisory Service were sending their own investigators to try out and find out what happened.

But in Thursday's Korea Times, NH Bank was already laying the blame for the outage on IBM Korea, which runs NH Bank operations via an outsourcing contract. The Korea Times article states that:

""The laptop of the IBM worker at issue ordered the deletion of execution files of our key systems, which involved more than one hundred IBM servers. This generated the service failure.""

""However, the employee seems to flatly deny any wrongdoing. We need to wait until ongoing investigations are completed to know exactly what or who caused all the trouble.""

Then on Friday, word was coming out that, in fact, not only were there still on-going problems with NH Bank credit card and check card services, but also its ATMs and on-line banking. While all the services were said to be ""available,"" they were highly unreliable.

On Saturday, this Yonhap News Agency article stated that reliability problems with NH Bank services were continuing into the weekend. It also said that:

""The Seoul Supreme Prosecutors' Office said about 20 National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (Nonghyup) and IBM Korea employees will be questioned in relation to the network glitch that has affected services since late Tuesday.""

Then yesterday, Kim You-kyung, head of a special recovery task force at NH Bank, implied in this Joongang Daily story that the outage was an inside job deliberately meant to crash the bank's network:

""The goal of hacking is for an outsider to infiltrate a system and profit by acquiring specific information. However, in this case the infiltration was made from within Nonghyup and a command to destroy all server systems was attempted simultaneously.""

The Daily article goes on to say that, ""Credit card transactions between 4:56 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday were deleted not only from the main server but also from the backup server. ""

This more in-depth article today by the Yonhap News Agency, which called the incident premeditated, reported that:

""The prosecutors said they had secured evidence showing that a batch of computer files containing commands to attack a key server of Nonghyup were installed on a laptop owned by an employee of IBM Korea, a Nonghyup subcontractor. The laptop was the source of the April 12 attack.""

The Yonhap News Agency article also reported that an investigator stated:

""We see that the perpetrators prepared for the attack for at least one month, considering our traces of the programs... It will take time to form an outline of the incident because it was designed precisely and meticulously.""

In addition, the article says that the investigators have ""... imposed a travel ban on two to three Nonghyup and IBM Korea employees in charge of maintaining the bank's network security. ""

No possible motive for the attack has been given, as of yet.

The Joongang Daily story says that it will take NH Bank a few more days to fully recover:

""The biggest problem with the system now is in credit card transactions. Between April 12, when the server crashed, and April 18, customers made 73,500 transactions worth 57.8 billion won ($53 million)... Nonghyup [NH Bank] said roughly 5 percent of the data on credit card transactions was lost after the servers were forced to shut down. It expects a full recovery of the lost data by April 22. ""

NH Bank also stated that Nonghyup it will be compensating customers for all damages, including late loan interest payments and commissions.

I'll update this story - and hopefully identify a culprit - as more information becomes available.","Korea,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,banking"

The long and the short of it was that a network change to upgrade its network's capacity went bad, which caused other bad things to happen.

Amazon's summary explanation states:

""At 12:47 AM PDT on April 21st, a network change was performed as part of our normal AWS [Amazon Web Services] scaling activities in a single Availability Zone in the US East Region. The configuration change was to upgrade the capacity of the primary network. During the change, one of the standard steps is to shift traffic off of one of the redundant routers in the primary EBS [Elastic Block Storage] network to allow the upgrade to happen. The traffic shift was executed incorrectly and rather than routing the traffic to the other router on the primary network, the traffic was routed onto the lower capacity redundant EBS network. For a portion of the EBS cluster in the affected Availability Zone, this meant that they did not have a functioning primary or secondary network because traffic was purposely shifted away from the primary network and the secondary network couldn't handle the traffic level it was receiving. As a result, many EBS nodes in the affected Availability Zone were completely isolated from other EBS nodes in its cluster. Unlike a normal network interruption, this change disconnected both the primary and secondary network simultaneously, leaving the affected nodes completely isolated from one another.""

You can read the rest of the summary to see what the node isolation caused, which included a ""re-mirroring storm,"" the task that Amazon faced when trying to fix the cascading problems, and what it has done and intends to do to try to keep this from being a problem in the future.

Amazon may also want to reiterate to its customers to plan for outages in the future, and configure their web sites accordingly.

Amazon says that it will be providing an automatic 10-day service credit as compensation for the outage, although some of its customers are grousing that it is not enough, says an article at the Wall Street Journal. The company hasn't said how it plans to compensate those whose data they could not recover or how much the compensation (and effort to resolve the outage) is costing. I guess we will have to wait for Amazon's quarterly report to find out.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,IT,,Impact - Raw"

A computer programming error had skewed the results to those registering for the lottery early, instead of selecting applicants randomly from across the full thirty-day registration period, the State Department stated on its Diversity Lottery web site.

The Diversity Lottery is part of the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, a congressionally mandated program that is administered on an annual basis by the State Department. The Department's web site states that the program ""... provides for a class of immigrants known as 'diversity immigrants' ... a maximum of 55,000 Diversity Visas (DVs) each fiscal year [which are] to be made available to persons from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.""

In addition,

""The annual DV program makes visas available to persons meeting simple, but strict, eligibility requirements. A computer-generated, random lottery drawing chooses selectees for DVs. The visas are distributed among six geographic regions, with a greater number of visas going to regions with lower rates of immigration, and with no visas going to nationals of countries sending more than 50,000 immigrants to the United States over the period of the past five years. Within each region, no single country may receive more than seven percent of the available DVs in any one year.""

Those winning immigration visas through the lottery don't need to have company sponsors or family members already residing in the US, which are usually the ways a non-US citizen gets an immigration card.

Some 90,000 US visa applicants are typically selected each year through the lottery. These winning applicants are then winnowed down to the 55,000 allowed through a series of interviews, background checks and medical exams, a Washington Post story says. This year, some 14.7 million applied to take part in the lottery, the AFP story reported.

The Post story says that the State Department noticed around May 5th that 90% of the winners of the visa lottery were selected from those who had registered during the first two days of the open registration period, which ran from October 5th to November 3rd last year. However, according to a Reuters story, by the time the error was discovered, 22,000 of the 90,000 winning applicants had already been notified that they had won.

As a result of what was described as a ""computer programming error,"" the State Department decided to void the lottery results altogether since they were not random as required by US law and therefore, it concluded, the results were ""unfair."" The Department will now select a new group of lottery winners and announce the results by mid-July.

The State Department did not say why the programming error occurred, given that it has been running the visa lottery since 1995. It would be interesting to find out the reason for the error.

Obviously, there are 22,000 unhappy people and some 14. 7 million who were going to be unhappy but are now not. I wonder how many of the 22,000 will be two-time winners.

As one side note to this story, apparently the US visa lottery is a source of Internet scams outside of the US, including countries that are not eligible for the lottery.","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Customs,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,airport/port/customs/systems"

The defense giant also will implement a series of improvements that address the findings and recommendations of an independent third-party audit.

The outage, which was a result of both technological and human errors, left 26 state agencies, including the Department of Motor Vehicles, scrambling to serve Virginians

“We are committed to holding all state contractors accountable for the performance of their duties on behalf of the commonwealth and its citizens,’’ Gov. Bob McDonnell (R) said in a statement. “This agreement brings closure to this incident, and provides the commonwealth with an improved information technology infrastructure that will reliably support Virginia’s citizens and agencies in the years ahead.”

“We are pleased to have reached an agreement with the Commonwealth regarding the disruption caused by the August 2010 outage,’’ said Christy Whitman, a Northrop Grumman spokeswoman. “In partnership with VITA, we are implementing new procedures, policies and safeguards to help avoid similar occurrences. Northrop Grumman’s commitment to the Virginia Information Technology Partnership is resolute and we look forward to continuing to work in the best interest of the Commonwealth and its citizens.”

Secretary of Technology Jim Duffey, who negotiated with Northrop Grumman on behalf of the state, said the financial package includes monthly invoice credits over the next 24 months totaling $1.908 million — representing the entire amount of direct costs incurred by the state as a result of the disruption.

Northrop Grumman also will spend $2.09 million making operational improvements to database backup, storage systems, system monitoring, database monitoring, network monitoring and capacity management; the company will also pay for $750,000 in improvements and $250,000 for the audit.

“I am satisfied that Northrop Grumman has been held accountable and that the Commonwealth has been made whole,” Duffey said. “This compensation package will benefit all agencies impacted by the outage and enhance the state’s information technology infrastructure.”

McDonnell, who had criticized his predecessor, Timothy M. Kaine (D), for failing to properly manage the Northrop Grumman contract, pledged to run such programs as businesses.

McDonnell’s solution was to rework the state’s contract with Northrop Grumman, extending the 10-year agreement by three years and agreeing to pay the company $100 million more than originally envisioned, but adding new penalties for poor service.

Then-governor Mark R. Warner (D) proposed consolidating the state’s computer operations into one agency and overhauling the system after a legislative review in 2002 found that the state’s computer system was outdated and increasingly expensive to maintain. The General Assembly, then controlled by Republicans, approved.

The state accepted bids and selected Northrop Grumman, the giant Los Angeles-based defense company for the contract, the largest of any kind in Virginia history. But the contract has been plagued by problems from the start, including missed deadlines and poor service.

A blistering legislative audit released in 2009 found that the computer system had caused problems at almost every state agency that uses computers.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Information Technology,,,Impact - Raw"
2011-06-01T07:00:00Z,LightSquared Accused of Interfering with GPS Signals," LightSquared wants to provide wholesale only, integrated wireless broadband and satellite communications  ",,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/telecom/internet/lightsquared-network-faces-interference-of-its-own-making,true,LightSquared Network Faces Interference of Its Own Making,"In March, I blogged about a UK Royal Academy of Engineering report that looked into society's over-reliance on GPS systems. In the post, I mentioned some incidents of GPS jamming, and one in particular linked to a company by the name of LightSquared.

LightSquared is proposing to create a nationwide integrated satellite-terrestial based voice and Internet data service that, in its words, will ""transform the broadband industry to one that truly fosters innovation, creativity, and freedom of choice."" In January, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved (PDF) a conditional but controversial waiver to LightSquared to create its new network. The controversy stems from the aforementioned problem of GPS interference, which the FCC required LightSquared to investigate in conjunction with an FCC technical working group as part of its conditional approval.

The potential GPS interference problem has arisen as an issue because of the LightSquared plan to deploy some 40,000 powerful earth-based transmitters operating in the 1525-1559 MHz and 1626.5-1660.5 MHz bands which are close to the 1559-1610 MHz band that GPS operates in. Furthermore, most GPS units in use do not have appropriate filters or signal discrimination to keep them from receiving LightSquared signals.

A Wall Street Journal article a few weeks ago reports that LightSquared admitted that its system could cause interference, but the company also said that it had developed some technology fixes to limit it. That said, LightSquared also vigorously maintains that GPS device makers need to improve their devices. The company claims in a National Journal article last week that it has worked hard to keep its transmissions from ""bleeding into GPS bands"", whereas GPS devices routinely ""look"" into the spectrum that LightSquared uses. GPS devices need to be improved instead of constraints placed on its network operations, LightSquared argues.

The WSJ says that the Defense Department, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Federal Aviation Administration among other government agencies have been voicing concerns over LightSquared's new network and the FCC's approval of it. The DoD and DoT have been most outspoken in their concerns.

Others companies, such as the farm equipment manufacturer John Deere, are also worried about LightSquared’s plans. John Deere argues that if LightSquared is permitted to operate, serious damage could be caused to US agriculture because the ability of farmers to implement precision farming techniques that depend on GPS signals would be significantly or totally degraded. GPS device manufacturers are also obviously unhappy with the prospect of redesigning their devices, as are many GPS device owners who might be faced with upgrading their devices if they live anywhere near a LightSquared transmitter.

A GPS interference test in April performed at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico seems to support these concerns. The tests reportedly demonstrated a LightSquared transmission ""knocked out GPS receivers operating at distances of 600 feet to 185 miles from the company's base station,"" this story last week at NextGov stated. The story says that few current GPS systems would not be negatively affected by LightSquared transmissions.

One would think that these test results would cause the FCC to immediately rethink its waiver to allow LightSquared to build out its network. There is also strong political pressure on the FCC to reconsider its waiver as well.

However, there are billions of dollars at stake, says the WSJ article. For instance, it reports that:

""LightSquared has signed deals with a number of companies, including Best Buy Co. and Leap Wireless International Inc., to offer wholesale wireless Internet service, and had originally planned to launch limited service later this year. Delays for LightSquared also could be a problem for AT&T Inc., which has cited LightSquared as a viable competitor to regulators in the antitrust review of its $39 billion deal to acquire T-Mobile USA.""

This article in Wireless Week provides more background into who Light Squared is lining up to use its network.

A final working group report on the interference tests will be filed with the FCC tomorrow. I don't expect the FCC to instruct LightSquared to stop building its network, but to instead tell the company that it must show in another test later this year that the issues raised in the report have been addressed before the company will be able to offer its services for sale.

I also suspect that Light Squared will argue that it be allowed to use the spectrum furthest away from the what GPS receivers use, until a solution – technical as well as political – can be found.

I’ll keep you posted on what happens.

Update (16 June 2011)

Well, it looks like LightSquared will get another two weeks to present its report on how its proposed network potentially interferes with GPS signals.

According to this Reuters story from last night, LightSquared asked for and was granted the extension to 1 July. The story quoted LightSquared spokesperson Chris Stern as saying that there are 8 different working groups involved in providing inputs to the report, and this is slowing things down a bit:

""We don't have all the data. This is a really complex thing and we want to make sure we get it right.""

In addition, LightSquared told the FCC that:

""Based on preliminary test results, LightSquared determined that additional testing, beyond what had been planned initially, including alternative frequency plans to support its network rollout, was necessary to permit a proper evaluation... That testing has been performed, and it has set back the timetable, particularly in some subteams in which data is still being processed and analyzed.""

Given the amount of interference so far found (GM voiced its concerns to the FCC on Tuesday about LightSquared interference to its OnStar system), the thinking now seems to be on finding new spectrum for LightSquared. I don't know how feasible this would be for the FCC or LightSquared. Anyone really know?

2011-06-01T07:00:00Z,"US Government Files Fraud Charges over CityTime Billing, New York Wants SAIC to Pay Back $600 Million in Billings", Total project cost billed was $720 Million ,,,,,,,7.2E8,$,USD,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/new-york-city-to-citytime-prime-contractor-saic-fork-over-our-600-million,,New York City to CityTime Prime Contractor SAIC: Fork Over Our $600 Million,"You can't say that the New York City CityTime payroll and timekeeping system project scandal is boring to watch.

Yesterday evening, news outlets reported that Mayor Michael Bloomberg had sent a letter to SAIC's CEO Walter Havenstein demanding the company return some US $600 million it was paid in its position as prime contractor on the project.

In the letter, dated yesterday and copied to United States attorney Preet Bharara, Mayor Bloomberg writes:

The city relied on the integrity of SAIC as one of the nation's leading technological application companies to execute the CityTime project within a reasonable amount of time and within budget given the system's size and complexity.... The recent indictment of...SAIC's lead project manager...and the guilty plea of...SAIC's chief systems engineer...are extremely troubling and raise questions about SAIC's corporate responsibility and internal controls to prevent and combat fraud.... The scheme to defraud was so pervasive that the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York...stated that 'virtually the entirety of the well over $600 million that the city paid to SAIC on the CityTime project was tainted, directly or indirectly, by fraud.' ..."" Because the project was apparently tainted by fraud and kickback schemes, the city must be made whole. I am, therefore, requesting that SAIC reimburse the city for all sums paid to it, approximately $600 million, as well as the cost of investigating and remediating this matter. I am forwarding this correspondence to the United States attorney so that the city's position as a victim can be taken into consideration.

I say bravo to Mayor Bloomberg (I suggested something very similar in my post last week), who finally admitted on Tuesday that he—and the city—screwed up in keeping proper watch over the CityTime project. Quoting from a blog post at the New York Daily News, Mayor Bloomberg said, ""Certainly nobody paid as much attention to it as they should have, from me on down.""

And according to the Wall Street Journal, last week SAIC voluntarily refunded the city nearly $2.5 million for the money it was paid for SAIC's lead project manager's supposed ""work.""

The New York Times reported that SAIC released a statement following Mayor Bloomberg's letter, saying in part that

SAIC understands and shares the outrage expressed by the city at the fraud alleged on the part of former employees and subcontractors on the CityTime program. These actions are an affront to everything we stand for as a company. SAIC is ready to discuss appropriate resolution of this matter, considering the breadth of the fraud alleged and the fact that SAIC delivered a system that the city said this week is working well.

Of course, SAIC has not said why it failed to catch the alleged fraud, even though whistle-blowers came forward in 2005 complaining about possible mismanagement and alleged kickbacks on the project, a point also raised in Mayor Bloomberg's letter.

The Wall Street Journal also said the city is looking into a civil suit against SAIC, presumably to try and get its money back if SAIC balks at the mayor's demand.

I should note that Mayor Bloomberg said as recently as last week, even after the new criminal indictments were filed, that he thought that the cost increases on the CityTime project were generally legit and that they stemmed from the city and SAIC's ""underestimating the complexity and cost of the project and then, as they went along...adding things."" The mayor's comments may come back to haunt him if a civil suit ever goes to trial.

New York City still owes SAIC $32 million for completion of the project, but it won't release the money until the criminal probe is complete. Given Mayor Bloomberg's letter, SAIC may never see that money, no matter how many times it says the CityTime software is working well.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,payroll"

As a result, payments into and out of Westpac weren't processed Monday night into part of this morning.The glitch left many Westpac Bank customers as well the customers of the three other major banks in Australia - ANZ, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) and National Australia Bank (NAB) - with insufficient funds in their accounts for a good part of today.

Westpac promised to clear up the problem and its aftermath by the end of today, and early reports Wednesday morning local time seem to indicate that it had succeeded. Westpac's ATM, POS, online banking, telephone banking and branch banking were not directly affected by the processing glitch.

Westpac's situation is reminiscent of the overnight processing problem suffered by CBA last December, and the massive outage also caused by a corrupted file that disrupted NAB's overnight processing last November.

Last September, a server patch degraded Westpac's online banking for a good part of a day as well.

In April, Australian bank customers were told to expect 15 years of shared pain as the country's major banks upgraded their aging IT infrastructure. For many bank customers, 2025 can't come soon enough.

2011-07-01T07:00:00Z,Chicago's Project Shield Canceled after 8 Years and $45 Million Wasted, Audit report stated their was virtually no project management or oversight  ,,,,,,,4.5E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/chicago-project-shields-depressing-post-mortem,,Chicago Project Shield's Depressing Post Mortem,"A couple of years ago, I blogged about a homeland security project called ""Project Shield."" It was supposed to provide Chicago's Cook County with a state-of-the-art broadband capability to stream live video from dozens of fixed and mobile video surveillance cameras to first responder command posts, some of which were to be mobile, throughout the 128 municipalities within Cook County in case of a terrorist attack or other emergency.



The project was started in 2003 in response to the 911 attacks and was slated to be completed in 2008 at a cost of $31 million paid for by grants from the Urban Areas Security Initiative that were funneled through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, after numerous delays and cost overruns, the project was finally canceled last summer at a cost of $45 million after a Cook County internal review found it an ""ill conceived, poorly designed and badly executed"" program, according to a Chicago Tribune story from last summer. The Tribune story noted that the review found that the $65 000 surveillance cameras mounted into 138 police cars not only didn't work, but blocked the cars' air bags, creating a safety hazard for police officers. The County was also found to be paying a company $190 000 a month to maintain project equipment that apparently didn't work in most cases.



The debacle caused Illinois Representative Mike Quigley and Senator Mark Kirk to request the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct an audit of the program. The OIG report (pdf), which was completed last December, was finally released a couple of days ago. The findings were depressingly familiar.

According to the OIG audit:

""Cook County did not ensure that the concept of the project was adequately tested before awarding an initial $12.8 million contract and subsequent contracts for approximately $23 million for the project.""

Nor did the project take into account some well-known environmental characteristics of Chicago, in particular the way it can get very cold in winter and very hot in summer. Electronic equipment used in that kind of outdoor environment is going to be highly stressed, but the audit noted that:

""... during the first encounter with seasonal temperature changes, the hardware did not perform within the required parameters. The temperature fluctuations caused equipment failures that were not predictable, resulting in delays as the problems had to be investigated and resolved.""

In addition, the fixed surveillance equipment was ""... not always effectively located,"" such as being pointed towards ""... police parking lots, streets, and intersections with questionable homeland security benefits. Fixed cameras were also installed in police station lobbies, which sometimes duplicated existing capabilities.""



The software required also proved to be an issue:

""The county learned during the implementation phase that the software on the Project Shield wireless computers was not compatible with municipalities’ central dispatch systems. This resulted in some police officers being unable to access critical databases from their vehicles for such items as criminal records, warrants, license plates, and vehicle registrations.""

When the OIG asked why there was such poor project planning, Cook County officials said that, ""... the project was initiated at a time when funds were not available to conduct planning. Funds were targeted to projects ready for implementation."" The OIG report disputes this assertion as absurd.

By the way, the project spent $12,496,924 in its first year, with apparently none of it being spent on doing any planning on how it was to be spent. I guess that reduces the cost of your management overhead.



As I mentioned above, all 128 municipalities that make up Cook County were supposed to receive surveillance equipment. Well, after almost seven years, the OIG found that:

32 never had equipment,

9 left the program after participating in the project, and

87 have Project Shield equipment, of which 71 have vehicle video systems.

When the OIG visited 15 municipalities that had received Project Shield equipment, nearly 70 percent of them complained about the lack of training in how to use it as well as the equipment's performance capability. Some 40 percent also said they were ""... unable to or unsure how to transmit video from the vehicle to the command center.""



The OIG reported (in a bit of fine understatement) that:

""Cook County did not always comply with procurement, property, and record requirements. We found missing records, improper procurement practices, unallowable costs, and unaccountable inventory items. We were unable to reconcile invoices with the contracts and modifications, and we could not verify that all incurred costs were reasonable, allowable, and allocable.""

For example, the final phase of the contract

""... had only one change order, which extended the contract 6 months without additional costs. However, this contract increased from $10.9 million to approximately $23 million, and the contract period was extended over 2 years.""

There's more, but I don't want any U.S. taxpayer reading this to blow a heart valve from anger and disgust..



The OIG says the ""weaknesses"" in the implementation of Project Shield:

""... can be attributed to Cook County’s inadequate management of the project, as well as the ineffective monitoring by FEMA and the State of Illinois.""

Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the OIG report basically recommends that everyone needs to do a better job of monitoring next time, to which everyone said they would.



Hopefully, the calls by Representative Quigley and Senator Kirk for the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate the mess will be heeded. The FBI was supposedly looking into the project in 2009 when things were already off the rails, but nothing seems to have come of it.

And while they're at it, the FBI may also want to take a look at how $11 700 of Homeland Security Grant Program money came to be used to purchase 13 sno-cones machines in Michigan. Well, at least they apparently work.","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

Sometime around the 19th of July, Oncor apparently installed a software upgrade to its computer systems that provide electricity consumption data from the electric meters of commercial and residential users to Oncor's retail electric provider customers. However, reports a blog post last Friday at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, there was a ""glitch"" in the upgrade that prevented information from about 10 percent of the meters—or about 330 000 of them—being read properly over the course the next 10 days.

This in turn prevented the retail electric providers from billing their business and retail customers per usual. As a result, the customers affected by the meter reading glitch either received a double bill—two months of electricity charges in one month's bill—or were sent two electric bills about two weeks apart.

Electricity consumption has broken records because of the record heat in Texas, which has sent electricity bills skyrocketing. So naturally, customers who received two months' charges in a single bill were not happy, even though they went a month without having to pay a bill. Many retail electric providers have said that they would help those customers affected by the glitch who might have trouble paying their bills.

Oncor says the software problem has been fixed, and that it apologizes ""...for any inconvenience it has caused to customers.""

In a different type of automation error but also affecting an energy company, two weeks ago the BBC reported that EDF Energy, Britain's largest electricity generator, admitted that some 100 000 of its customers have been over-charged for the past seven years, from October 2003 to May 2010, because there was a glitch EDF's automated telephone meter reading system. An unknown number of customers were undercharged because of the glitch as well.

Most of the overcharges were less than £5, but some were found to be nearer £500.

An EDF spokesperson said that:

""We would like to apologise to those customers impacted by this issue and reassure them that as soon as it was identified, corrective action was taken.""

Hopefully, EDF's next automated mistake won't take seven years to identity and correct.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Energy and Utilities,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected"

The pilot of a medical helicopter that crashed in Missouri in 2011, killing all four people on board, was distracted by personal text messages that day and during the fatal flight, federal safety investigators said on Tuesday.

The National Transportation Safety Board found that the text messages were likely a contributing factor in the crash of the medical air ambulance and prompted officials to recommend new prohibitions on the use of portable electronic devices by flight crew members.

""This investigation highlighted what is a growing concern across transportation - distraction and the myth of multi-tasking,"" Deborah Hersman, head of the NTSB, said in a statement released with the board's report.

""When operating heavy machinery, whether it's a personal vehicle or an emergency medical services helicopter, the focus must be on the task at hand: safe transportation,"" Hersman said.

The Eurostar AS350 helicopter crashed near an airport in Mosby, Missouri, in August 2011 after running out of fuel while transporting a patient from one hospital to another about 60 miles away. Killed were the pilot, flight nurse, flight paramedic and the patient.

The NTSB found that the probable causes of the accident were the pilot's decision to take off despite critically low fuel levels, along with his inability to perform a critical flight maneuver after the engine flameout that followed when the helicopter ran out of fuel.

But the board said cell phone records showed that the pilot sent and received multiple personal text messages throughout the day, including while the helicopter was in flight and during a phone call to a communication specialist about whether to undertake the mission.

The NTSB said there was no evidence the pilot was texting at the time that the engine failed, but said that doing so at all while he was airborne violated his company's cell phone use policy.

Among the nine recommendations that the NTSB made were that flight crew members be prohibited from using portable electronic devices while at a duty station on the flight deck while the aircraft was being operated.

The board also recommended to the Federal Aviation Administration that pilot training programs incorporate training on the dangers of distraction by portable electronic devices.

On Sunday, the company announced (PDF) that it was recalling 80 111 CR-V vehicles from the 2006 model year in the United States to replace the power window master switch because of a design flaw. The flaw, Honda says, ""can allow residue from interior cleaners to accumulate, which can, over time with switch use, cause the electrical contacts to degrade and may lead to a fire in the switch.""

In addition, Honda stated that it is also recalling 5626 CR-Z vehicles from the 2011 model year in the United States that are equipped with manual transmissions, to update the software that controls the hybrid electric motor. Under certain circumstances, it is possible, according to the company, ""...for the electric motor to rotate in the direction opposite to that selected by the transmission.""

Worldwide, 936 000 vehicles are affected by the two recalls.

In August, Honda also recalled (PDF) 2.5 million 2005–2010 4-cylinder Accord, 2007–2010 CR-V, and 2005–2008 Element vehicles—1.5 million in the United States—to update the software that controls their automatic transmissions. According to Honda,

""Without the updated software, the automatic transmission secondary shaft bearing in the affected vehicles can be damaged if the transmission is quickly shifted between each of the reverse, neutral and drive positions, as may be done in an attempt to dislodge a vehicle stuck in mud or snow. If the bearing is damaged in this unusual scenario, it can cause the engine to stall or lead to difficulty engaging the parking gear. The update to the vehicle’s automatic transmission control module software will ease the transition between gears to reduce the possibility of damage.""

Honda hasn't been the only auto company to issue recalls to fix software problems this year. For example, in August, GM recalled 4293 2012-model-year LaCrosse sedans in the United States and Canada because of software that could negatively affect braking; in June, the company recalled 50 500 2011-model-year Cadillac SRXs over an airbag-related software glitch; and in March, GM recalled more than 10 000 2011-model-year LaCrosse and SRX vehicles to fix software in the electronic climate control module that could disable the ability to adjust and control the defroster and thus affect a driver's visibility.

In addition, in May, Volvo recalled 7558 2012-model-year S60 sedans to replace software for the fuel pump units, explaining that the software might not be ""compatible with all fuel pumps and components, resulting in insufficient fuel transfer in the pump units,"" which could cause the vehicle to stall.

In April, Nissan recalled some 5500 of its new Leaf all-electric cars to fix some faulty software that could erroneously indicated a problem with the vehicles' air conditioning unit, which in turn would trigger an engine warning that kept the car from restarting after it was turned off.

In a different type of auto software–related problem, in February, Ford recalled 8022 2011-model-year Ford F-150, F-250, F-350, F-450,F-550, Edge, and Lincoln MKX trucks manufactured from October 25, 2010, through November 20, 2010, because of a glitch in an integrated diagnostic system (IDS). The IDS contained a custom software routine that reads the vehicles' body control module (BCM) serial number, and based on the number read, the BCM is supposed to be replaced (or not). However, there was an error in the software routine so the vehicles' BCMs weren't being read correctly. Not replacing a defective BCM could lead to a fire.

While there have been no high-profile recalls of Ford vehicles because of a software glitch so far in 2011, Ford CEO Alan Mulally admitted in June that there have been ongoing problems with its Sync and especially MyFord Touch technologies that the company has to get a handle on.

And finally, according to a story at Automotive Industry Digest, the company Warranty Direct (which sells extended auto warranties) says its data show electrical faults (including software defects) now account for 27 percent of all the car-failure claims it receives. In 2006, these types of faults made up only 23 percent of their claims. Why the increase?

According to Duncan McClure Fisher, of Warranty Direct,

""Electrical faults are extremely common, and the amount of computer technology we demand in our new cars today is to blame... We pay a huge number of claims to fix highly complex systems such as the electronic control units at the heart of modern cars.""

Warranty Direct doesn't seem to think that the upward trend it is experiencing will flatten out, let alone decrease, any time soon.

Executive Editor

Federal News Radio





The National Archives and Records Administration is ending the development phase for the Electronic Records Archive system next September.

David Lake, ERA's communications director, said as result of the Office of Management and Budget's TechStat session, NARA and OMB decided to end this phase of the contract with Lockheed Martin earlier than expected to focus on getting agencies to use the current system's functionalities before adding new ones.

""We are going to get this phase of development completed by the end of fiscal 2011,"" said Chuck Piercy, NARA's acting CIO. ""OMB hasn't dictated any contractual things we need to do. We've been working closely with Lockheed Martin and we have a large amount of work to accomplish in the next 11 months. We believe we will be able to get it done and achieve final operating capability with the ERA system and get all the cabinet level agencies using ERA by the end of calendar year 2011.""

NARA has a sixth option year on the Lockheed Martin deal for development, and seventh year for operations and maintenance.

""We have been directed by OMB to discontinue the development component at the end of fiscal year 2011,"" Piercy said. ""Originally, there was an additional one year option available to do development. This final option was for operation and maintenance. There were seven options total.""

Piercy added that NARA may choose to recompete the operation and maintenance portion of the contract, but the agency hasn't decided how it will proceed.

""The decision to end is about a year earlier than originally planned,"" said David Lake, communications director for ERA. ""This is something through the TechStat process that OMB essentially mandated in 2011. We are following all those decisions. There are other parts of the TechStat process they asked us to go through like a program improvement plan. We continue to work with them and provide them with updates on the progress so far.""

Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Sheila Collins said the company is working closely with NARA in the final year of development for ERA functionality.

""Lockheed Martin will continue to work in close partnership with NARA as contracted to complete delivery of the ERA solution in a phased, five-increment system approach,"" she said. ""We are currently beginning development of the final System Increment, Increment 5, which is on target to complete by Sept. 30, 2011. Our contract with NARA allows the government to exercise a final option year six for operations and maintenance of the ERA system.""

Collins added that ERA already is helping NARA preserve and provide long-term access to electronic records.

Lake said NARA may begin develop of ERA again in 2014 after all large agencies are using the system.

NARA is waiting on Congress to ensure further development of ERA can happen. The Senate proposed NARA would receive $72 million for ERA in the fiscal 2011 omnibus spending bill now making its way through the Congress.

Lake said NARA would use that money, if approved by lawmakers, for continued development, operations and maintenance and possible transition to a new contractor.

NARA awarded Lockheed Martin the $308 million contract for ERA in 2005. Lockheed and NARA hoped to gain initial operating capability by 2007 and full operational capability by 2011.

But the Government Accountability Office found in June that the estimated cost of the ERA system has increased, and the development is behind schedule. Over the last three years, the estimated cost has increased by about seven percent, from about $531 million to about $567 million as of February 2010. GAO said the higher costs includes not only the development contract costs, but also program management, research and development and program office support, among other things.

In addition, the planned completion dates for the two increments currently under development are about one year later than dates established in program planning documents, auditors found.

GAO also found in October that NARA fell behind its initial schedule. Auditors say only two increments received initial operating capability and NARA expected further development of the system to achieve full operating capability by 2012.

""The identified deficiencies in NARA's management of the ERA project leave it with little assurance that ERA will be able to avoid additional cost increases and schedule delays,"" auditors wrote in the June report to Congress. ""As a result, it is increasingly unlikely that NARA will be able to deliver the ERA system by the planned date of 2012 with the capabilities originally envisioned or to effectively use the system to meet the needs of its users in support of NARA's mission.""","US,Project Failure,Government,National,Information Technology,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency"

The NPfIT was once called by the National Health Service ""the world's biggest civil information technology programme,"" and it will at least for now also hold the record for the largest failed IT program in the world (some elements of it—the Spine, N3 Network, NHSmail, Choose and Book, Secondary Uses Service, and Picture Archiving and Communications Service—were delivered). I have written about the travails of the NPfIT here and elsewhere for Spectrum over the past several years.

According to the Department of Health press release:

""The government today announced an acceleration of the dismantling of the National Programme for IT, following the conclusions of a new review by the Cabinet Office’s Major Projects Authority (MPA). The programme was created in 2002 under the last government and the MPA has concluded that it is not fit to provide the modern IT services that the NHS needs. ""In a modernised NHS, which puts patients and clinicians in the driving seat for achieving health outcomes amongst the best in the world, it is no longer appropriate for a centralised authority to make decisions on behalf of local organisations. We will continue to work with our existing suppliers to determine the best way to deliver the services upon which the NHS depends in a way which allows the local NHS to exercise choice while delivering best value for money.""

Exactly how much has been spent on the NPfIT is not known. Estimates start at about £12.7 billion and go up from there. I doubt that the true cost will ever be known, especially the substantial developmental costs absorbed by the main suppliers and never billed for (often because they couldn't deliver what they promised).

The course forward now is to let local health authorities ""exercise [EHR] choice while delivering best value for money.""

What will happen to the £4 billion in contracts already signed with CSC and BT, the two main NPfIT suppliers, was not stated in the press release. However, as late as August, the NHS was arguing against canceling them both because of the IT expertise the suppliers provided as well as the cancellation costs built in to the contracts.","UK,Project Failure,Government,National,Health and Human Services,,£,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

Officials conclude program isn't the best use of resources, nor central to aiding veterans

The Veterans Affairs Department is cancelling its $400 million financial system modernization program, and will direct those resources to other projects throughout the agency, a senior official has confirmed.

The VA’s Financial and Logistic Integrated Technology Enterprise (FLITE) modernization program is not central to the department’s mission and core responsibilities, Roger Baker, assistant secretary for information and technology at the VA, said during a press conference this morning.

“Prioritization of the projects has been the primary driver of this, along with the recognition that we can’t do everything,” Baker added.

Instead, VA wants to work on projects closer to its overall mission, such as modernizing the veterans benefit system and upgrading its health records system. “We have limited resources, and we have to make certain that we’re going to be successful at the large projects that we do decide to roll forward with,” Baker said.

OMB to review 20 financial system modernization projects

VA's CIO is 'comfortable' with flat IT budget

The FLITE program was a multiyear initiative to standardize business processes and update the IT infrastructure that supports financial and asset management inside the VA. The program consists of two parts: the Integrated Financial Accounting System (IFAS), the largest component, and the Strategic Asset Management System. It also includes the VA’s Financial Reporting Data Warehouse service, which integrates several separate systems. IFAS and the data warehouse make up approximately two-thirds of the entire program, according to Baker.

The overall FLITE program had an estimated price tag of between $400 million and $500 million, Baker said. So far, the VA has spent $16 million over the last several years in the planning phase for IFAS.

Baker said the VA has yet to award the most important task order, which is for the IFAS component, and that was the key to making the decision right now. The VA had been holding the procurement because of problems in the program. And, while straightening out those issues, officials realized the FLITE program was not a priority item, he said.

Instead, the VA would consider working on the financial system with smaller projects that have less risk and a greater likelihood of success, Baker said. The VA has had its current core financial management system (FMS) since the 1990s. He said the VA can fix its financial management weaknesses by addressing the systems that feed into FMS. Through smaller projects, the VA wants to make sure it can track its financial data being fed into the core system, Baker said.

The VA’s decision comes just two weeks after the Office of Management and Budget put a hold on all financial system modernization projects, of which the VA’s FLITE program was scheduled to be reviewed by OMB officials. Before OMB’s memo announcing the hold, VA and OMB officials had been in discussions about the future of the project, Baker said.

""These are the right decisions to make. They're hard decisions,"" Baker said. While the financial system needs attention, ""we need to do things that we know we are going to be successful at and that are going to be the most impactful with the dollars that we spend.""","US,Project Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"
2011-10-01T07:00:00Z,"BlackBerry Experiences Email and Internet Outages across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa"," Server blamed for disruptions that last almost three days, over 70 Million customer affected ",,,3,days,72.0,7.0E7,,,,EMEA,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/telecom/wireless/glitch-leaves-millions-of-blackberry-owners-without-email-internet,,Continuing Problem Leaves Millions of BlackBerry Owners Across Globe Without Email and Internet,"There are news reports this evening about a major problem with RIM's BlackBerry Smartphone services. According to an AP story, an unspecified problem beginning at about 1000 GMT today cut off email and Internet access, including BlackBerry Messenger service, to millions of BlackBerry users across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The AP story says that the problem was blamed on RIM server problems in Canada, while this story from the Independent in London blamed the outage on RIM servers issues in the United Kingdom.

A story in the Financial Times of London reports that at least 10 million of RIM's 70 million BlackBerry users were affected. While the problem occurred mid-morning in Europe, it wasn't until late afternoon that RIM acknowledged there even was a problem, the FT reported. That slow response has probably not sat well with BlackBerry users, many of whom may be looking to buy rival Smartphones and don't need much of an excuse.

In a short—two sentence—statement, the RIM apologized to its customers ""for any inconvenience caused.""

The AP story says that RIM is also warning that ""...some customers may continue to experience delays with instant messaging and browsing services.""

There have been a couple of notable BlackBerry outages over the past few years as well (see here and here, for example).

I'll update this story as better information becomes available.

Update (Oct. 11, 2011)

After RIM said that everything was back to normal this morning, apparently there are new problems with BlackBerry services this afternoon—albeit with the same symptoms—cropping up today across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

RIM has been very closed-mouthed concerning the outage from yesterday, and they are no more open about today's. Customers are not happy.

I'll again update this as events transpire.

Update (Oct. 12, 2011)

Late yesterday, RIM finally said that it had traced the problem it was having to a ""core switch failure within RIM's infrastructure"" as well as a failure of a previously tested back-up switch. The company had hoped that services would be back to normal by today.

Unfortunately, there are new reports today that indicate that not only has the problem not been contained and solved, but that instead it has spread into North America. According to this AP report, some Canadian and U.S. BlackBerry users have found that they are now having trouble with their email service.

This note posted today on BlackBerry's Web site at 9:45 (GMT-5):

""BlackBerry subscribers in the Americas may be experiencing intermittent service delays this morning. We are working to resolve the situation as quickly as possible and we apologize to our customers for any inconvenience.""

It is unknown how many BlackBerry users are now affected, but probably many more than the 10 million thought to be affected on Monday when the problem first emerged.

Update (Oct 13, 2011)

Well, it finally looks like RIM's major service problems are receding but they may still continue for some BlackBerry users for awhile.

RIM, after being exceedingly tone deaf to the criticism it was receiving for being so uncommunicative about the service interruptions,finally posted more than a couple line cryptic explanation as well as a video apology this morning from Mike Lazaridis, President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of RIM.

In the video, Co-CEO Lazaridis apologized for the outage and stated that BlackBerry services were slowly coming back online. However, he also said the company could not say for certain when all services across all regions would be back to normal. He said there still could be service issues cropping up.

The BlackBerry press release, which was a statement from Robin Bienfait, RIM's CIO gives another apology as well as provides status information as of late yesterday for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, Canada and Latin America and for the US, each of which were affected slightly differently. The main focus of RIM now seems on working through the backlog of emails and other messages. The press release seems to confirm that a very large portion of RIM's 70 million BlackBerry users were affected by the outage.

It will be interesting to see whether this latest - and likely to be longest and most far reaching - outage will have any material affect on the company's long-term outlook. The next big issue will be dealing with compensation demands from both corporate and individual users, more than a few who are exceedingly angry. If RIM handles this poorly, it will be another nail in the company's reputation and market place coffin.

Update (Oct 14, 2011)

BlackBerry service now seems to be fully back to normal. There are no news reports of any continuing service problems.

It is estimated that some 40 million BlackBerry users were affected by the glitch, although none within Japan itself (Japanese BlackBerry users did have trouble connecting to non-Japanese BlackBerry users, however).

As I mentioned yesterday, claiming compensation for the outage seems to be the main concern of users now. RIM has made no official comment on paying compensation other than to tell customers that:","EMEA,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,Blackberry"

According to the IBTimes, about 5 minutes after the ASX opened at 1000 local time, the ASX was shut down due to a ""technical fault"" with its trading platform. However, this evening local time, ASX sent out a press release (PDF) stating:



""The market was halted due to a network connectivity issue that prevented participants from interacting with the trading platform.""



ASX also said trading activity should be normal tomorrow. Trading soared once the system was restored at 1400 local time, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.



Traders were frustrated with the outage - the second one this year - because they were very anxious to trade on the news of (yet another) agreement by EU leaders to address the debt crisis there.

According to a report in the BBC, the cause of the problem was traced to a faulty server.

2011-11-01T07:00:00Z,Amadeus Reservation System Glitch Affects Airlines Worldwide," Boarding passes had to be printed out by hand by Qantas, BA, Air France and Lufthansa for several hours ",,,140,minutes,2.3333333333333335,,,,,Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/aviation/worldwide-airline-reservation-hiccup-cured,,World-wide Airline Reservation Hiccup Cured,"At approximately 0640 AEDT today, Qantas Airways staff worldwide discovered that they could no longer print passenger boarding passes, according to an article in the Melbourne Herald Sun. They also discovered that the airline's self-serve kiosks were not printing out boarding passes, either.

As a result, Qantas check-in staff were forced to write out airplane boarding passes by hand. In addition, the airline sent messages to customers asking them to print out their boarding passes at home or send their boarding passes to their smart phones if at all possible.



Needless to say, Qantas passengers this morning were very unhappy about the resulting long check-in lines and delayed flights. Exacerbating their unhappiness was that Qantas has not exactly been popular in Australia since the airline shut itself down without warning a few weeks ago, and many departing passengers perceived this glitch as yet another poke in their eye.



As it turned out, glitch was quickly traced to a problem in the Amadeus reservation system that Qantas and dozens of other airlines use. Not only was Qantas affected by the print error, but so were British Airways, Air France and Lufthansa, The Australian reported. The impacts on these other airlines was luckily minimized given that the glitch happened early in the morning AEDT and not during their morning departing rush European time.



At about 0900 AEDT, the problem was resolved and things slowly returned to normal. An Amadeus spokesperson was quoted in a later Sydney Morning Herald story as saying:

""Amadeus can confirm that the issues related to printing of boarding passes from our departure control system experienced this morning have now been fully resolved.""



""We are currently investigating the cause of the issue that occurred today and regret any inconvenience caused to our customers. We remain committed to providing the industry's leading information technology services that support many airlines around the world.""

This is the fourth reservation-related problem that Qantas has experienced since it rolled out its Amadeus Altea Departure Control-Flight Management system in 2008 (see here, here, and here).","Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,airport/port/customs/systems"

Alas, news reports like this one by Bloomberg News yesterday afternoon indicate that consumer-electronic store Best Buy is having to cancel some on-line customer orders because the company has run out of ""hot product orderings."" The demand for those product offerings were hyped by Best Buy itself as a way to compete against Wal-Mart, Amazon and Target, its main competitors. The Bloomberg story notes:

""The canceled orders covered the weekend after Thanksgiving, when Best Buy stepped up discounts against Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) Best Buy promoted 'aggressively online,' leading to higher traffic and an increase in sales by stores open at least 14 months, Chief Executive Officer Brian Dunn told analysts on Dec. 13.""

Too bad Best Buy's management forgot the old adage, ""Be careful what you wish for, you might get it.""



Best Buy will no doubt take a very deserved beating in the press for the next couple of weeks for this ""Grinch Glitch"", especially in light of its ""guaranteed delivery by Christmas"" advertising blitz.



In addition, according to an updated Bloomberg piece in Advertising Age, Best Buy which ""... has been at the forefront of using social media to engage with its customers..."" has gone strangely quiet about the issue, a fact for which it is also now getting beat up for by its customers.



It will be especially interesting to know when Best Buy knew it had an inventory problem before it decided to let its customers know. This story, for instance, at Minnesota Public Radio says Best Buy was still taking orders yesterday morning for Christmas delivery.



Best Buy, however, is not alone in getting coal in its holiday stocking.



Turns out, UK retailers Sainsbury's and Fortnum & Mason are also having problems. According to a BBC story, some 200 to 300 customers of Sainsbury's have had their online Christmas meal order inadvertently canceled. This article at the London Telegraph explains the problem this way:

""Customers who ordered food on Sainsbury’s web site to be delivered in time for Christmas found that their all-important delivery slot disappeared if they temporarily clicked back to check their order at the end of their shop.""

Sainsbury's apologized ""... unreservedly to customers who have been inconvenienced in any way"" and is trying to work out compensation for the glitch.

The London Telegraph is also reporting that ""severe issues with its IT infrastructure"" is keeping upscale retailer Fortnum & Mason from being able to deliver an unknown number of its famous Christmas hampers - some of which cost up to £5,000 - from being delivered by Christmas. The Telegraph says that some 100,000 such hampers are sent out around the world by Fortnum & Mason every holiday season.



The Telegraph says that hundreds of hampers may not be delivered, but it may well turn out to be significantly higher than that. Fortnum & Mason is offering refunds for undelivered hampers.



And finally, Virgin America looks like it is starting to turn a corner in dealing with the fallout from its reservation system rollout of late October. According to a story appearing Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, Chief Executive David Cush stated that ""... most of the bugs have been fixed and that 95% of transactions now are successful.""



However, CEO Cush also admitted that ""... call center wait times still average 14 minutes and bookings made with reservations agents take 30% to 40% longer than they did, a situation that will probably last another month.""

Given that the problems were previously promised to be resolved by the first week in December, I might view that prediction with a bit of skepticism.

As a result, trading in 222 stocks and 12 exchange-traded funds, five convertible bonds and two real estate investment trusts (see pdf for a full listing) was halted for some three and a half hours, from around 0900 to 1230 local time.



In addition, the Sapporo Securities Exchange (pdf), which shares the same Fuji Ltd. developed ""arrowhead"" trading system, had to suspend trading in 74 shares.



The stocks affected included Sony Corp., Hitachi Ltd., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Tokyo Electric Power Co. On Wednesday, Sony announced the appointment of a new CEO, and yesterday it also announced losses for the fourth year in a row. As one could imagine, traders were bemoaning the glitch as being most inopportune, this other Bloomberg story reports.



There has been a spate of stock exchange technical glitches the past several months across the world. Last month, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange halted trading for an hour due to a network problem. Further, according to a Reuters story, the JSE ""was forced to halt trade several times last year, due to problems with the connection to its trading engine in London.""



A few days before the JSE glitch, the Financial Times of London reported that a ""technical glitch"" delayed the start of trading on the SIX Swiss Exchange for three hours. The FT article also noted that ""more than 20 [technical glitch] incidents were reported on Europe’s share trading venues last year with NYSE Euronext, Borsa Italiana and the London Stock Exchange among those to suffer high-profile outages as messages went missing, index levels failed to update and hardware failed. Last month BATS Chi-X Europe, Europe’s largest share trading venue, was knocked out for more than seven hours.""



Then in December the NASDAQ suffered a problem with that resulted in quoting delays as it opened, while in November the New York Stock Exchange has a problem disseminating trades and quotes in about 300 stocks. Also in November, the Toronto Stock Exchange experienced a glitch that affected stocks with ticker symbols M through Z. In addition, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) experienced an outage for four hours in late October, its second outage of the year.

The numerous glitches, as well as the ""flash crash"" in 2010 and the continuing number of mini-flash crashes since then, have caused the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revisit its exchange disaster management guidelines it developed in the 1980s, a story last week in the Wall Street Journal reported.



The concern is that the ""technological arms race in financial markets,"" as Andrew Lo, director of the Laboratory for Financial Engineering at M.I.T. put it in a recent New York Times article, may be creating unintended consequences that could cause chaos in the markets if a trading system goes haywire.



The SEC hopes, the WSJ says, to develop guidelines ""to span the 13 U.S. stock exchanges and other"" that would lay out in an orderly way what would happen in case of exchange outages or other technical glitches.



Some exchanges off the record told the WSJ that they think the current SEC disaster management guidelines are perfectly fine and don't need to be revised. These exchanges argue that because the potential financial/reputational consequences for stock exchanges created by a major technical glitch are so high that they will do everything in their power to keep one from happening.



Yeah, right. I've heard that sort of reasoning before in regard to other financial institution endeavors; I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now either.



And I bet that the Tokyo Stock Exchange thought those back-up servers would work without fail, too.","Japan,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,stock exchanges"
2012-03-01T07:00:00Z,United-Continental Merged Reservation System Hits Major Turbulence," United CEO claimed that system was well prepared, but it was anything but ",,,1,months,720.0,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/aviation/united-airlines-reservation-system-cutover-still-hitting-patches-of-rough-air,,United Airlines Reservation System Cut-Over Hits Another Patch of Rough Air,"On the 3rd of March, United Airlines, the world's largest airline, moved to a single passenger service system and single web site, marking the final elements of its merger with Continental Airlines, which is no more. The cut-over didn't go as smoothly as the dress rehearsal earlier this month, which itself had some problems.

For the live event, not all check-in kiosks worked correctly, electronic tickets for some reservations weren't synchronized with passenger records, and frequent flier miles weren't updated correctly. In addition, there were issues involving the new web site.



On the 13th of March, as problems persisted, a senior United executive said that the cut-over was about halfway complete, implying that by the 23rd or 24th of March all the issues would be ironed out. This admission that United expected about 3 weeks of trouble was news to many United flyers, especially since the airline's CEO Jeff Smisek had raised expectations that the change-over was going to go smoothly and quickly, and that airline was ""exceedingly well prepared for it.""



Well, here we are on the 29th of March and the notice that first appeared on the United web site on the 3rd of March remains:

""Our Contact Centers are currently experiencing extraordinarily high call volumes. In some cases hold times exceed an hour, and you may be prompted to try your call at another time. We are working to improve this service level and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.""

An AP story at Bloomberg Businessweek makes clear those problems still persist. ""There were widespread reports of passengers waiting on hold to fix ticketing problems,"" it said. ""Many said that they could not get through at all. Odd balances were showing up in frequent flier accounts.""



A story at the Houston Chronicle reports a persistent problem, which United says it is close to resolving, that inconveniences its elite flyers:

""When elite fliers purchase a ticket, McCarthy [a United spokesperson] said, their names are automatically placed on an upgrade list, which is 'processed in intervals leading up to the departure time"" based on a flier's status.' ""



"" 'Sometimes in that process, the system encounters an anomaly, something that's not correct and it stops all upgrades for that flight,' McCarthy said. 'It doesn't happen for every flight, but when it does happen, a number of elites are not getting upgraded on the schedule they expect and so they call United to get assistance or they're seeking out assistance at the airport.' ""

Given that United still has 600 additional call center staff working the phones and wait times are still long, I have a hard time believing that a sporadic problem involving only elite flyers is causing many of the airline's customer care problems being reported.

In the Chronicle story, United is also strongly implying that everything will be fine very, very soon.



For those of you who have been regularly flying United since the cut-over, have things markedly improved? Or does it seem that the airline still has a lot of work to do to get its act together? Are United ticket and boarding agents at the airports finally at ease using the new system, which was originally a Continental system? This was a problem widely reported the first week.

When do you think the airline will be back to operating to the same level of service before the cut-over happened?","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,airport/port/customs/systems"

Now, after 244 years, ""the 32-volume Encyclopaedia Britannica print set will be discontinued,"" according to an announcement on Britannica's web site. The 2010 set (which costs US$ 1 395) will be the final print edition before the Britannica goes completely digital.

According to a story at the Washington Post,

""The top year for the printed encyclopedia was 1990, when 120,000 sets were sold ... That number fell to 40,000 just six years later in 1996... The company started exploring digital publishing in the 1970s. The first CD-ROM edition was published in 1989 and a version went online in 1994.""

Over 100 million people use the online version of the Britannica, according to a company spokesperson.

Starting Tuesday, the Post says, ""the company plans to mark the end of the print version by making the contents of its web site available free for one week.""

I bought my copy of the 15th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica as a young engineer in 1980 for about $750 or so. While I don't use it much anymore, I still get an inexplicable feeling of reassurance whenever I glance over at my bookcase and see it there. That feeling hasn't happened yet with any of the digital devices I have ever owned (although I must admit I still have fond feelings when thinking of my old Mac Plus and Motorola V300, which are stashed away in a closet).

New York City will get $466 million of the $500 million as compensation (Mayor Bloomberg had originally demanded $600 million). It also states that the New York paid SAIC $589 million since 2000.



As you may recall, the CityTime project was the effort to develop a secure, web-based time and attendance system for the 80 Mayoral and other agencies of the City of New York that was originally estimated to cost some $63 million and ended up ""costing"" $720 million. Last year, Bharara declared the project a ""vehicle for unprecedented fraud"" in a press release announcing charges against several project participants.



SAIC's press release this week to its employees put an interesting spin on the whole CityTime affair and its part in it. The release starts out saying that the settlement allows the company to ""move forward as a better, stronger company dedicated to the highest standards of ethics and customer performance."" Of course, to make sure that it keeps up its dedication, an independent outside monitor will be appointed to watch over its every move for the next three years.



The press release goes on to claim that SAIC was ""victimized"" too, by some very bad actors. What the release doesn't say, however, is that those nasty managers (both its own as well as its sub-contractors) were the very ones over which it failed to provide any oversight, even after the company was warned back in 2005 that something was seriously amiss in the project. Perhaps it was because those very managers were pulling boatloads of cash into SAIC's coffers?



And in the press release's ultimate ""break out the violin"" moment, SAIC complains that the company isn't getting any kudos for the great IT system that it produced.

""Frequently overlooked in this case is the fact that SAIC developed and delivered a world class workforce management system for New York City. The system covers 163 000 city workers and has increased the effectiveness and efficiency of the city's administrative processes. In the end the capabilities of our magnificent solution have been obscured by the self serving, unethical behavior of people we assumed were loyal members of our team. We must dedicate ourselves to never letting this happen again.""

The press release continues to blather on about how this experience will, in the future, make it a better corporate citizen, it promises from now on to do the right thing, and so on.



Mayor Bloomberg's own press release on the settlement weirdly parallels SAIC's. With righteous indignation, His Honor trumpets that:

""Today’s settlement is a major victory for taxpayers, and just as importantly, it is a major a victory for justice and public integrity. Our Administration has zero tolerance for corruption and since day one we have focused on rooting out corruption and preventing it from occurring in the first place.""

Okay, but maybe the Mayor can explain further exactly which day he's counting from. Even after the scandal morphed from outrageous cost overrun to outright fraud, Bloomberg sought to play down the CityTime problems as just being a natural result of building big, complex IT systems in which the city ""actually did a pretty good job,"" even in retrospect.



Like SAIC, the Mayor conveniently forgot to mention in his press release the city's lack of oversight of its own managers who—through colossal incompetence and overlooked conflicts of interest, at least one of which featured actual criminal intent (pdf)—allowed the fraud to flourish for seven years before being ""discovered.""

Maybe sometime the billionaire businessman-mayor will explain how that level of risk mismanagement was allowed to happen on his watch.

Naw.

2012-04-01T07:00:00Z,New York City's Emergency Call System Costs Climb from $1.3 Billion to over $2.3 Billion, Only one out of two call centers completed ,,,,,,,,,USD,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/new-york-citys-emergency-call-system-controversy-continues-unabated,true,Controversy Over NYC Emergency Call System Continues Unabated,"Back in 2004, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the city would once again try to modernize its 911 emergency call system. The previous attempt, begun in the early 1990s, ended years later with nothing to show for the tens of millions of dollars sunk into it. Bloomberg's initial $1.3 billion plan called for two call emergency call centers to be constructed (one being a backup), along with a unified computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system covering the Fire Department (FDNY), Emergency Medical Services (FDNY-EMS), and Police Department (NYPD).

In early 2005, HP was hired as the system integrator to develop the first call center and place it into operation by late 2005. The second call center and CAD system were to be completed sometime the next year.



However, it took until 2007 for the current modernization effort, called the Emergency Communications Transformation Program (ECTP), to begin in earnest at a now estimated cost of $1.5 billion and a revised scheduled completion time of 2010. A reason for the delay was the poor oversight and governance of the project by various city department managers, according to a New York City Comptroller audit that came out a couple of weeks ago. The audit report (pdf, press release here) states that ""questionable judgment, poor decisions, and deficiencies in ECTP governance structure ... caused key decisions not to be made in a timely manner."" For example, the FDNY and NYPD both claimed to ""own"" the emergency call system. It isn't hard to imagine how the subsequent infighting slowed the project's progress tremendously.



The audit report also notes the original technical effort involved in creating a unified CAD system was sorely underestimated. The CAD system completion date had to be pushed back into the summer of 2007, but continuing issues have meant that even today a unified CAD still is but a wish; nor is there even a definitive date for one to be put into operation. The on-going delay has caused the NYPD to decide to develop its own new CAD system, at a cost of $87.6 million, scheduled to be put into operation sometime late this year; the FDNY is also planning to build a new CAD system of its own at a cost of some $50 million, but a date for its initial operations has not yet been finalized.



The Comptroller's audit goes on to state that the total cost of the two new emergency call centers sans unified CAD system will now land in the neighborhood of $2.3 billion. The first call center went live this January, while the second one is currently scheduled for completion in 2015. The second call center, expected to cost $700 million when complete, is being built by Northrop Grumman, as HP's contract ends this year.



The audit report, which highlighted the enormous cost increase and scheduled delays, caused an expected ruckus, as did the claim by the administration that the 911 project was basically okay and did not have a major cost overrun. The administration argued that the expected higher cost just reflected a better understanding of what was required of the system (i.e., a new set of requirements). When costs for the movie ""John Carter"" ballooned, at least studio officials didn't claim that it was on-budget for a different movie than originally conceived.

Instead of quieting down as these things usually do after a few weeks, another report, with the title of 911 Call Processing Review, is instead keeping the controversy in the headlines. The review was conducted by a consulting firm on behalf of the Bloomberg Administration to look into the City's widely-criticized emergency services' response to the 2010 Christmas Day snow storm. At the time, the mayor promised ""to get at the truth"" as to why the emergency services seemed so unprepared.



Well, apparently the truth uncovered is a bit ugly and embarrassing, and the mayor is now refusing to release the study. According to the New York Daily News, the report says that despite all the hundreds of millions of dollars so far spent to improve New York City's emergency call system communications and emergency crew response times, the new capabilities seem to be instead slowing down emergency responders.



Bloomberg claims the report is only a working document, is incomplete, and does not reflect current reality, so he doesn't see any need to release it. The New York State Supreme Court disagreed, ordering the release of the report last Friday, but that order has been stayed by an appeal filed by the administration.



After the criticism the mayor received because of the CityTime scandal, it is not surprising that His Honor isn't anxious to highlight yet another fiasco. But given that it will be years before the second call center is placed into operation, it is likely that he will be hearing complaints about his handling of the project until His Honor's term expires at the end of next year.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency"

In 2003, Australia’s Victorian government embarked on an ambitious modernization of the state’s health IT infrastructure. The idea was to combine its health-related financial systems with its patient record management systems through the creation of a comprehensive, Victoria-wide electronic health record (EHR) system. The original HealthSMART project budget was $A323 million and a completion date was set for June 2007. However, by the end of 2007, while some 57% of the money had been spent, only 24% of the project had been completed. Projected costs to complete had risen to $A427 million, and a roll out date was estimated to be sometime in late 2009. There was talk at the time of cancelling the project, but the government decided to keep the effort alive given what it believed to be its significant potential benefits.

By late 2010, questions were again being raised, especially by the newly elected Baillieu government about whether HealthSMART should indeed be cancelled. The completion date had now slipped to sometime late in 2012, and the project costs were still rising, with at least another $A100 million being seen as needed to finish the job. The government decided, after lobbying by the Australian Medical Association Victoria and others, that it was in a “In for a penny, in for a pound” type of situation, so it held its collective nose, and soldiered on.

However, by early this year it became increasingly apparent that the end of the EHR effort was still not in sight, even though $A566 million had now been spent on it. So last week, the Victorian government decided it was no longer going to “throw good money after bad,” ZDNet Australia reported. It scrapped the project, but announced a new plan to set aside $A100 million to help individual hospitals improve their health IT. Health Minister David Davis was quoted in the ZDNet story as saying that:

“In those hospitals where it has been put in place or partially put in place, health services will make their decisions from that position, but going forward, beyond that, health services will be able to examine what is appropriate for their particular service.”

Shades of what happened in the UK with its national EHR program.

That said, at the national level, the Australian government is still continuing its support of the controversial personally controlled electronic health records (PCEHR) system, which is supposed to begin its roll out across Australia this July. Prime MInister Gillard's government has recently even allocated $A233 million in this year’s budget (on top of the original appropriation of $A466 million) to bolster the effort's probability of success.

At the same time, the government has also been trying to dampen down expectations about the PCEHR system, saying that it will take years before it will actually be useful. But the government predicts that the changes it will make in the way medical data is handled will eventually save Australia $A15 billion in government-related health costs by 2030. Given the current state of the PCEHR system and the lukewarm support of it by the Australian populace and medical profession, that amount sounds more like political wishful thinking that an estimate grounded in economic reality.","Australia,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

Butkovitz Says New Water Billing System Still Defective

City Controller’s audit of the Revenue Department finds new owners of sheriff sale properties were billed for previous owners’ delinquent balances

Department of Revenue FY2008-09

PHILADELPHIA – City Controller Alan Butkovitz today released the latest audit of the Department of Revenue that found the new owners of 669 sheriff sale properties in fiscal year 2009 were billed for interest and penalty charges from the previous owners’ delinquent balances. This error occurred in 20 percent of the total sheriff’s sales that took place in FY09.

The billing error is a result of a continued programming flaw that exists in the Water Revenue Bureau’s new “Basis 2” water billing system. The Controller’s prior reports of the new water billing system found a number of deficiencies that resulted in property owners being incorrectly billed.

“If property owners are unaware of the inaccurate billings, they may be paying for the charges improperly imposed, which is unfair,” said Butkovitz. “Furthermore, the detailed water receivables are misstated in the city’s books and records.”

Subsequent to receiving a misstated water bill, the city has placed the responsibility on new property owners to notify the City’s Water Revenue Bureau to have the interest and penalty amounts removed from their accounts. The incorrect billings for the 669 sheriff sale properties resulted in approximately $2.5 million in account adjustments that had to be made by the Water Revenue Bureau.

“New owners of sheriff’s sales should not be placed with the burden of having to correct their water bills,” said Butkovitz. “If the City wants to improve, and more importantly increase, sheriff sales, it needs to immediately correct this billing mistake.”

Basis 2 is the City’s fifth attempt to fix its faulty customer billing system. Since January 2007, the City spent $49 million on the five customer billing systems.

Additional findings from the Department of Revenue audit include the following:

-Numerous personal computers deemed as surplus, and no longer in use, were still maintained on the premises because the hard drives still contained sensitive taxpayer information which had not been erased – increasing the risk of theft.

-The custodian of the Water Revenue Bureau petty cash fund improperly paid parking tickets for violations incurred by department employees. The Finance Office refused to reimburse the Water Revenue Bureau because it should have been paid by the employee. There is now a shortage of $359 in the fund.

2012-06-01T07:00:00Z,New York City Auditor Claims $163 Million Fraudulent Billing in Emergency System Project Billing, Mayor Bloomberg disagrees with auditor's findings ,,,,,,,,,USD,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/nyc-emergency-call-system-overbilled-by-163m-city-auditor-claims-fraud,true,NYC Auditor Claims Fraud in $163M Overbilling for Emergency Call System,"Last April, I blogged about the long-running problems with New York City’s attempts to modernize its 911 emergency call system. The latest effort, called the Emergency Communications Transformation Program (ECTP), began in 2005 at an estimated cost of $1.3 billion and a completion date of 2007 has ballooned into a $2.3 billion plus effort with a completion date of (hopefully) 2015.

A new audit report released by New York City Comptroller John Liu yesterday raised previous charges of incompetent project management to the level of potential fraud on the part of Hewlett-Packard, the original prime system integrator on the project.

Liu’s press release states that “the contractor selected to streamline the City’s vital 911 call system was unqualified and so poorly monitored that it was able to overbill taxpayers by as much as $163 million. Because of the severity of the findings and potential for fraud in both the vendor selection and billing processes, Comptroller Liu has referred the matter to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office for further review.”

Echoing the earlier charges of incompetent, Liu also says that the cost of the system could rise another $362 million because the work required was poorly performed.

City officials as well as New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have vehemently repudiated the audit findings. According to the Comptroller’s Office, the audit is “premised on a fundamental misunderstanding of the scope of HP’s work as system integrator… This misunderstanding is also the basis of the audit’s unsupportable conclusion that the system integration work for ECTP ‘could be’ up to $362 million over budget.”

The Comptroller Office unsurprisingly “strongly disagree(s)” with the City’s objections. Similarly unsurprisingly, HP has had no comment so far on the accusations contained within the audit report.

Most disagreements like this can be put down to politics—in this case, the mayor is still smarting over the CityTime scandal that Liu helped bring to light, and for his part, Liu will likely be running for mayor next year and wants to be seen as a stalwart steward of the taxpayer's money—but it seems likely that there's yet another financial scandal looming here.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency"

But one that continues to fascinate me is the saga of the Queensland Health payroll system, which will likely play out for at least five more years.

According to Australian news stories like these at the Delimiter and the Australian, an audit report (PDF) by the consulting company KPMG into the status of the payroll system indicates that it will cost another A$220.5 million—on top of the A$311 million already spent—to fix nine priority items that prevent the payroll of the 85,000 or so Queensland Health employees from being calculated without massive manual intervention. Currently, the audit report states, “1,010 payroll staff are [still] required to perform over 200,000 manual processes on an average of 92,000 forms to deliver approximately A$250m (gross) in salaries to QH’s 85,000 staff each fortnight.”

The audit report also makes it clear that the estimated A$220 million does not include any contingency funding in case problems arise with the proposed fixes. It doesn't give an indication on how uncertain its A$220 million estimate is.

KPMG further notes that an additional A$25 million should be set aside for system analysis “in order to determine the requirement for further investment in either a system upgrade or a system reimplementation.” You see, contracted support for the core payroll system software begins to expire at the end of 2014, and it may be wise for Queensland Health’s management to assess what is needed in terms of either a major system upgrade or system reimplementation before then.

In addition, KPMG states in its report that, “The costs associated with [a] system upgrade or implementation have not been quantified to date and represent additional costs beyond the current ‘minimum’ identified and outlined in the report which relate to a preliminary ‘systems analysis’ only.”

One can only wonder how much a replacement payroll system will cost given the inaccuracy of previously estimated costs. For instance, back in 2008, the original cost of the payroll system development was pegged at A$6.19 million (fixed price), which has steadily grown as problems such as the massive overpayment or underpayment of employee salaries ran rampant. (Issues with these salary mispayments, which still total at least A$91 million, won’t likely be resolved for years.) Even as recently as last July, you may recall, the government emphatically claimed that after spending a total of A$311 million on the payroll system (A$102 million for its initial development and another A$209 million to fix it), it was (then) stabilized and no further money would ever be needed to be thrown at it.

BTW, KPMG notes that another A$836.9 million will be required to operate the payroll system for the next five years. That is, if nothing else bad happens.","Australia,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,payroll"
2012-06-01T07:00:00Z,"Software Update Crashes UK RBS Bank Group IT Systems, Over 6 Million Customers Without Access to Accounts", System outage also hits banks and their customers across UK ,,,,,,6000000,,,,UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/natwest-banks-nightmare-starting-to-end-,,RBS Group Banking Nightmare Beginning to End,"The computer problems plaguing RBS Group banks including NatWest, Northern Ireland’s Ulster Bank, and the Royal Bank of Scotland are finally ending, according to news reports today. NatWest is saying that the technical issues have been resolved and that most bank accounts should be updated and back to normal by the end of the day on Monday, although there may still be “bumps in the road.” The same appears to be true for RBS account holders. However, the problems at Ulster Bank will likely continue for the remainder of the week, the BBC reports.

According to the Guardian, the computer problems, which have caused the longest and worst bank-related IT outage in UK history, were traced to a software update to RBS’s payment processing system that became corrupted. The software problem erupted last Tuesday night when millions of bank accounts across all three banks failed to be updated. However, according to this story at Computing.co.uk, the software glitch actually dates back to a week ago Friday. It may take some time before the true facts of the matter come to light, since the RBS Group is refusing to publicly discuss the exact cause of its computer woes.

NatWest, which last year saw complaints about its service rise 75 percent over the previous year, certainty hasn’t helped itself during its crisis. While the bank's CEO apologized to the its customers for “the inconvenience"" to ""some customers,"" Steven Hester waited a long time before making an appearance in public. The bank, which has been saying that the computer problems would not cost its customers anything out of pocket, also didn’t win any friends by urging customers with account problems to call its costly toll number for help. When questioned about it, the bank said that customers could later make a claim to try to get reimbursed for the cost of the call, although it didn’t tell its customers how to make such a claim.

NatWest also told customers of other banks that have been affected by the glitch to straighten out any problems they were having with their own bank. The UK Financial Services Authority ""urged other banks to be 'lenient' with their own customers if they missed payments because transfers from RBS accounts had not come through,"" this London Telegraph story reported. The story goes on to state that, ""The banks have pledged to refund their customers, but only if they contact them directly and are able to prove they have been hit by the technical failure.""

The FSA will no doubt take a look into the mess.

Another thing that must have irritated NatWest customers was that right through early this morning, NatWest had a small banner at the top of its website acknowledging customers' inability to access their accounts, while right below it was a conspicuous ad proudly boasting: “We have award-winning online banking. Does your bank?”

Not really a smart thing to do when your award-wining online banking system isn’t working. Sometime late this morning London time, someone at the bank must have noticed the discontinuity in its marketing message and all the website ads were taken down; the web page is now focused on the corporate apology for the mess and a customer FAQ list.

RBS Group announced today that it was going to keep 1200 bank branch offices open from 8am to 6pm for the rest of the week to help out customers. Branches were open over the weekend as well.

The final cost of the fiasco that the bank’s CEO said “should not have happened” could reach nearly 100 million pounds; not good news being that the bank is 82% owned by the UK taxpayer.","UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Banking and Financial,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,banking"

The Federal Bureau of Investigation system, called Sentinel, now serves as the bureau’s records repository and provides agents and analysts with a Web-based system to manage evidence and automate the review of documents, the agency said today.

The project was announced in 2006 at an estimated total cost of $425 million to replace the agency’s paper-based files. It was originally scheduled to be in place more than two years ago.

More than 30,000 FBI employees have used the system since the bureau officially made the switch on July 1, the bureau said today. The final amount allocated for the project was $451 million.

After multiple critical reports from the Justice Department’s inspector general, delays and cost overruns, the agency reduced the role of contractors involved in the development process and took full control in 2010.

The bureau demonstrated Sentinel for reporters at FBI headquarters in Washington today.

The Justice Department’s inspector general in December released a report outlining concerns over costs, effectiveness and schedule delays. It was the inspector general’s eighth report on the project.

So begins the judge's order in the legal outsourcing battle between the state of Indiana and its former IT service provider IBM. While deciding last week that Indiana failed to prove that IBM materially breached its 2006 $1.6 billion contract with the state, Marion County Judge David Dreyer wrote: ""This story represents a 'perfect storm' of misguided government policy and overzealous corporate ambition. Overall, both parties are to blame and Indiana's taxpayers are left as apparent losers.""

Indiana initially sued IBM for the $437 million it paid the provider for what it said was a failed welfare system overhaul, an amount that was later reduced to approximately $170 million. IBM countersued for $100 million that it claimed it was owed by the state. Judge Dreyer awarded Big Blue $12 million for the equipment retained by the state.

""[It is] surprising that the court found a pox on both houses,"" says Lawrence J. Bracken II, partner in the commercial litigation practice of law firm Hunton & Williams. ""This decision demonstrates these are cases that are very difficult to resolve in court. Not only are the matters and contracts very complex and the evidence comprised of millions of documents and data points, but typically each party shares some of the fault when these projects go off the rails.""

It was a rare judgment in favor of an outsourcing provider that should serve as a wakeup call for all IT leaders. ""Buyers have a tendency to select big-box service providers, because they feel more secure operating under the notion that if something goes wrong they can always sue [them] and recoup their losses,"" says Paul Pinto, managing partner at outsourcing consultancy Sylvan Advisory. ""Buyers believe that the larger service providers will not be willing to endure the bad publicity associated with a law suit. The result of this case clearly displays the contrary.""

More specifically, ""the case is a bit discouraging if you write careful contracts hoping that they'll be enforced as written,"" says Randall Parks, co-chair of the global technology, outsourcing and privacy practice at Hunton & Williams. The court took IBM's achievement of a limited set of service levels metrics along with its delivery of some unexpected benefits--supporting Indiana flood relief in 2008 and a ""plan B"" welfare system to replace the one that did not work--as evidence of acceptable contract performance, Parks says. ""For providers, it is apparently still possible to get an 'A' for effort. In the end, the decision seems to represent rough justice in a complex case.""

Pinto isn't surprised that IBM walked away unscathed. ""IBM prides itself on its ability to write and negotiate onerous contract terms. They have developed this skill through many years of experience, and wield it artfully,"" he says. "" Even though IBM did not perform in alignment with the intent of the agreement, they were deemed to have satisfied the letter of the law.""

IBM was able to avoid material breach of the contract by meeting somewhere between 50 and 80 percent of its service levels. ""Surprisingly, the court minimized problems that many IT managers would find unforgiveable, including a 48 hour call center outage, and readily gave IBM a pass for the difficult and politicized environment in which it was working,"" Parks says.

Big government IT outsourcing deals have a poor track record for success. Indeed, they may be doomed to fail from the start, says Adam Strichman, founder of outsourcing consultancy Sanda Partners, who says IBM actually made a valiant effort with this deal.

""What is hiding between the lines here is that the state wanted to change it's culture by outsourcing--always a difficult move, but almost impossible for a government organization. [Indiana wanted to] shift the [welfare] eligibility determination [process] from the state offices to a centralized call center."" says Strichman. ""Guess what--when they did that, the old organization magically still had control, and [then they were] paying for two organizations. State organizations are masters at never giving up control. This is a textbook case of why outsourcing often fails at the government level.""

Political rhetoric also made Indiana's assertions against IBM difficult to prove. ""Public-sector outsourcing is complicated by politicians' desire to claim success right up to the moment when they are forced to confess to a problem,"" says Parks. ""In this case, the repeated 'thumbs up' from various state officials were impossible to reconcile with the later claim of material breach. In government, line management often has very little ability to influence this sort of activity, even when the realities don't match the sound bites.""

Public sector IT organizations might far better if they adopted a more incremental outsourcing approach, says Strichman. ""Set up a shop that doesn't interfere with state jobs and fiefdoms. Roll out a high tech alternative in parallel with the status quo. Test it, work out the bugs, and roll it out selectively,"" says Strichman. ""A tiny contract would not have had so much riding on it, and could be tested until they got it without colossal budget pressures and bad press. It can work, if states stop biting off more than they can chew, and outsourcers and consultants stop serving it up that way with a smile.""

There are lessons in the case for IT leaders outside of government organizations, as well. At a time when outsourcing customers have been negotiating IT services contracts with fewer, more targeted service levels, ""this case says that more performance measures that might reduce a judge's discretion are worth the investment,"" says Parks. ""Customers can't count on the judge or soft concepts like 'material breach' to protect them. There is no substitute for precise performance definitions and careful, prompt management of departures on both sides.""

The Indiana-IBM fight also underscores the value of recent shifts in IT outsourcing philosophy--the importance of breaking up big projects into smaller deliverables with measurable results, the appeal of spreading risk across multiple providers, and the importance of robust outsourcing governance.

""Outsourcing is still a hit or miss proposition. The only way to increase the chance of success is to become a truly informed buyer,"" says Pinto. ""This case sends a clear message to the Buyers of outsourced services, that they cannot outsource their responsibility along with the engagement.""

2012-07-01T07:00:00Z,France Telecom Mobile 12 Hour Outage Affects 26 Million Subscribers, Compensation costs $25 Million ,,,12,hours,12,2.6E7,2.5E7,$,USD,France,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/telecom/wireless/france-tlcom-mobile-network-outage-affecting-26-million-subscribers-angers-government-ministers,,"France Télécom Mobile Network Outage Affecting 26 Million Subscribers, Angers Government Ministers","For nine hours, beginning last Friday afternoon at about 15:00 Paris time until 00:30 Saturday morning, some 26 million subscribers of France Télécom's mobile company Orange were unable to make calls, send text messages, or downlaod data. According to ComputerWorld UK, the database that keeps track of which cell a subscriber is connected to which is called the New Generation Home Location Register suffered a software error. Exactly why the error occurred is not known, and Orange is said to be consulting with equipment suppliers Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson to try to track down the root cause.

ComputerWorld UK reported that the register, which was supplied by Alcatel-Lucent, is made up of three elements: the front end, the central servers, and the databases. An Orange spokesperson stated in the article that, ""There were some inconsistencies in the data, and erroneous messages were exchanged between the different elements. That caused some saturations, leading to a snowball effect that blocked the system.""

Subscribers who didn't move from a cell were able to keep their service the longest, but eventually the error-queue in the register became so big that everyone lost service.

French ministers were not amused, and have called for an audit of France Télécom and other critical national infrastructure to ensure that it doesn't happen again, reports this Reuters story. The Reuter story implies that the new French government believes that the outage may be caused by excessive cost cutting by France Telecom.

According to this Bloomberg News article, Orange has 38 percent of the French mobile market (it is the largest Internet provider in Europe), which is experiencing intense competition and job cuts at French Telecom's competitors to reduce their operational costs (France Télécom laid off over 20 thousand staff a few years ago itself). Bloomberg quotes the CEO of France Télécom Stéphane Richard as saying that the outage was an ""isolated incident"" that had nothing to do with ""the level of investment in our networks.""

The Wall Street Journal noted that when the network crashed, senior executives frantically tried to call Richard at his country home, but they couldn't reach him; they didn't have his landline number, only his mobile.

France Telecom has said that it will compensate subscribers for the outage, which is expected to cost upwards to $25 million.","France,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency"
2012-08-01T07:00:00Z,Knight Capital Loses $440 Million in Errant Trading Due to Programming Error, Losses place company at risk of collapse ,,,,,,,4.4E8,$,USD,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/new-insights-into-knight-capital-trading-snafu,,"""Zombie Software"" Blamed for Knight Capital Trading Snafu","A Bloomberg News story yesterday shed a bit more insight into what caused the uncontrolled electronic trading by the market making brokerage Knight Capital a few weeks ago. It seems a dormant legacy program was somehow ""inadvertently reactivated"", and then interfered with (or took over?) the firm's trading on 1 August, when a new software trading program Knight had installed began operation. ""Once triggered on Aug. 1, the dormant system started multiplying stock trades by one thousand,” Bloomberg was told by two unnamed sources who were briefed on the matter.

Hmm, dead software becomes reanimated, takes over a computer system, and then runs amok. I think I've seen that movie somewhere.

Also, according to the sources, “Knight’s staff looked through eight sets of software before determining what happened.” Almost sounds like there was a graveyard full of dead software ready to be reanimated.

Unfortunately, the article doesn't say anything more about how the dormant software awakened and interposed itself when it came to executing trades that were supposed to be initiated by the new software Knight had installed. It also doesn’t say why Knight would keep “eight sets of software” apparently resident in its execution environment. We’ll probably have to wait until the SEC finishes its investigation to find out what actually happened as well as, presumably, some juicy details about Knight's software development and system testing practices.

Nevertheless, the so-called “Knight-mare glitch” (among others) has spurred regulators in Asia and Australia to “clamp down” on high frequency trading firms, the Financial Times reported this week. The regulators are “unveiling sweeping proposals that would require traders to have controls on their systems and test them annually to prevent market disruption,” the paper said. Regulators want “pre-trade” risk controls in place to keep “aberrant” trading from happening, as well as trading “kill switches” when the risk controls fail.

In related news, the FT also reported that the recent glitch at the Tokyo Stock Exchange was traced to a bad “router in its Tdex+ derivatives trading system.” For reasons not yet explained, a backup router failed to kick in. This is the second time this year that a TSE backup system did not kick in when it was needed.

A router problem also caused problems for several hours yesterday morning at California’s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). According to the Associated Press, a problem with a California state router caused the DMV’s computers to become disconnected from the state’s network from about 0800 to noon local time, no doubt exasperating and angering many customers. According to television station CBS Sacramento, the California DMV has apologized to its customers via Twitter 26 times alone since February for technical difficulties. The station has been investigating without much luck DMV outages that have apparently been taking the system down with some regularity since 2007.

By coincidence, several other California state agencies had computer networking problems yesterday as well, which the state blamed on an unexplained “circuit reconfiguration” issue. This unrelated issue, the AP reports, was also corrected by mid-day yesterday.

Finally, Manganese Bronze, the company that makes London’s familiar black taxi, announced this week that “it is delaying the release of its unaudited half-year results for the six months ended 30 June 2012 ... due to the need to restate prior years’ financial results because of accounting errors that have come to light.” The errors could probably be labeled computer-related errors, though, rather than accounting ones.

According to a company statement, in August 2010, a new integrated IT accounting system, which was installed to help manage the company’s “complex global supply chain,” missed some key transactions during the cut-over: “Due to a combination of system and procedural errors, a number of transactions relating to 2010 and 2011 and some residual balances from the previous system were not properly processed through the new IT system. This problem led to the over-statement of stock and under-statement of liabilities in the financial statements of previous years.” As a result, the company understated by £3.9 million its historical losses.

Manganese Bronze has been under heavy competitive pressure, or in its own words, “Trading in the first seven months of the year has been difficult and remains challenging with the Group continuing to trade at a loss.” Although it expects the situation to eventually improve, the current strong competition from Mercedes-Benz (which now provides nearly a third of the London taxi fleet) and some expected new competition from Nissan’s new low emission taxis may not bode well for the company’s future financial health. The FT reported that Manganese Bronze stock fell 34 percent on the news of the results restatement and now only has a market value of some £5 million.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,stock exchanges"

Greg Reed, president of eHealth, confirmed Tuesday that notice of termination has been sent to CGI Information Systems and Management Consultants Inc.

A resolution passed by the eHealth board of directors on Sept. 5 had recommended terminating the $46.2-million agreement to build a diabetes registry.

CGI and eHealth announced the six-year deal on Aug. 9, 2010 for the company to design, build and maintain the registry to better monitor diabetes patients.

Spokesman Robert Mitchell has said no money has been spent on the unfinished registry, and alleged CGI had regularly missed development deadlines.

Health Minister Deb Matthews says she supports the decision by eHealth to cancel the contract, noting it protects taxpayers from $46-million in spending.

“The Ontario Diabetes Strategy continues to be implemented, including ensuring that every person with diabetes in Ontario who wants a family doctor has access to one,” Matthews said.

“I am working in partnership with diabetes advocates, like the Canadian Diabetes Association, to ensure that the electronic component of the Ontario Diabetes Strategy best serves the needs of people with the disease,” she said.","Canada,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,Contract termination/cancellation"
2012-09-01T07:00:00Z,F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Struggles with Software, Software issues likely to delay jet's initial operational capability dates ,,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/military/f35-program-continues-to-struggle-with-software,true,F-35 Program Continues to Struggle with Software,"In 2001, after it had beat Boeing for the Joint Strike Fighter contract, Lockheed Martin Chairman Vance Coffman boasted that Lockheed would deliver a “truly remarkable, capable and affordable multi-role fighter, on schedule and on cost.” Back then, the F-35 Lightning II had a planned initial operating capability (IOC) for 2010 for the Marine Corps version (F-35B), 2011 for the Air Force version (F-35A), and 2012 for the Navy version (F-35C).

Those dates had already slipped by five or more years when, on Monday, U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the incoming director of the F-35 program, told the annual US Air Force Association conference that he was not optimistic that all the program's current problems—especially those related to software, which has long been a sore point (pdf)—would be fixed in time to meet the now hoped for Marine Corps 2015 IOC. He didn’t estimate what then might happen to the 2018 or so Air Force/Navy hoped for IOC dates. ""Hoped for,"" because the services have been exempt for the past two years from having to officially declare an IOC date, given the past IOC schedule slippages. I suppose you can't miss a due date when there is no date.

Bogdan said there were continuing issues with the F-35 advanced helmet, which, when (if) it finally works, will allow a pilot to “see through the airplane.” Currently the helmet suffers from jitter problems, latency issues, and the inability to see sharp images at night.

Bogdan told the conference audience, “You cannot go to war and you cannot fight with this airplane unless you have a helmet that works. Today, we have a helmet that works in a very rudimentary way.”

Lockheed has signed a contract with a second helmet maker for one that has less capability, but Bogdan said that the DoD “was still evaluating how quickly the alternate helmet could be integrated into the airplane,” according to a Reuters story.

Bogdan further stated that there have been IT security, maturity, and cost problems associated with the aircraft's Autonomic Logistics and Information System (ALIS). Without ALIS working properly, the “airplane doesn’t work,” Bodgan stated flatly. Problems with the latest ALIS software release have “held up delivery and payment of the latest aircraft out of the F-35 final assembly line at Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth plant,” Aviation Week says.

Then there are those problems in the overall software development for the aircraft, as Reuters also reported. Back in March, the F-35 deputy program manager Air Force Maj. General John Thompson said that the recurring problems with software development could bring the program to its knees. Even though there has been extra effort spent to get on top of the issue, from Bogdan’s comments, software could stlll kneecap the program. There are now some 24 million lines of code—operational and support—needed for the F-35 to be fully operational; when the program started, the estimated number of lines of code required was closer to 15 million.

As if Lockheed's challenges weren't enough already, the company will have to fix the plane’s problems without more money from DoD. Bodgan stated in stark and unmistakable terms that, “There is no more money and no more time on this program. We will not go back and ask for more, simple as that.”

Bodgan’s statement was backed up by Air Force Secretary Michael Donley who also said, “The department is done with major restructures that involve transferring billions of dollars into the F-35 program from somewhere else in the defense budget. There's no further flexibility or tolerance for that approach.” If there are more cost overruns on the program, then the number of planes would be cut back, the scheduled would be slipped even more, or the aircraft’s capabilities would be reduced, Donley indicated. All three at once are a possibility as well.

Those warnings are probably not going to improve the DoD-Lockheed Martin program acquisition relationship, which Brogan termed the “worst I’ve ever seen.” Maybe it’s because not only is the F-35 so troubled-plagued and late, but that its total estimated development and sustainment costs are likely to be a $1 trillion over the aircraft’s 50-year projected life. Perhaps Bodgan suspects, as I do, that is a low figure given how ""accurate"" predictions of defense programs costs usually turn out to be.

Coffman's boast, which included that the US and the UK (who was an original JSF program partner) could trust the company to get the job done right, looks a might hollow now.","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,,Impact - Raw,airplane"

Share prices of RIM took a hit of 3 percent this morning in part due to the problems, Reuters reported.

According to ZDNet.UK, the service issue took out Blackberry customers' email, web browsing and BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) functionality; however, not all EMEA Blackberry users were equally affected by the problems, apparently. Vodaphone users seem to have taken the brunt of it.

A story at T3 published a statement by RIM’s CEO Thorstein Heins that stated in part that, ""I can report that no data or messages were lost. Up to 6 percent of our user base may have been impacted."" The statement went on to say that RIM is ""conducting a full technical analysis of this quality of service issue and will report as soon as it concludes.""

Just earlier this week, T-Mobile customers who owned a Blackberry 9900 also experienced trouble with their emails and web browsing.

Last October, Blackberry suffered a significant outage that lasted several days that damaged its once sterling reputation for reliability of service. This latest one, albeit of short duration, may have almost as much impact on the public's perception of the company given that it is also the day when Apple launches its iPhone 5. Nothing like having a bad hair day when your major competition is showing off their latest acclaimed beauty. Most telling is that when the news of this latest glitch appeared, most of the reaction by the public seemed to be in some form of “Blackberry who?”

A few months back, Heins vowed to transform the company into a ""lean, mean hunting machine, but it looks ever more like a lean, maimed hurting machine. And with the latest iPhone launching today, new phone announcements recently by HTC, Motorola, Nokia and Samsung, and the Blackberry 10 still sometime off in the future, “Blackberry who” may soon be less of a joke and more of a serious question.","EMEA,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,Blackberry"
2012-10-01T07:00:00Z,Sprint Cable Cut Hits Airlines using Sabre Reservation System for an Hour," Alaska, American, Frontier and SouthWest all affected ",,,1,hours,1,7000,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/aviation/sprint-cable-cuts-smack-alaska-airlines-hard,,Sprint Cable Cuts Smack Alaska Airlines Hard,"I wonder if Alaska Air Group's enterprise risk management team had this risk on their watch list.

At 0730 Pacific Time yesterday, Alaska Airlines (and its sister carrier Horizon Air) started experiencing what it termed at the time to be a “software outage” that brought down its SABRE reservation system, forcing the airline to go in to manual operation mode. As you can expect, chaos soon took hold at its check-in desks.

It took a bit of time for Alaska and SABRE to discover that it wasn’t a software issue at all but a network connectivity-related one: a Sprint fiber-optic network cable was accidentally cut during maintenance work being performed on a railroad track someplace between Chicago and Milwaukee.

The severed Sprint cable also affected other airline users of SABRE, including American, Frontier and Southwest Airlines. However, after about 45 minutes, these airlines were able to once again access SABRE as reservation and other passenger data was automatically rerouted over another portion of Sprint’s network. Few flight disruptions were reported by these airlines because of the outage.

Unfortunately for Alaska Air, another Sprint fiber-optic cable, this one an aerial cable located somewhere between Portland, Oregon and Tacoma, Washington was mysteriously cut as well yesterday morning Pacific time. This second severed cable happened to be the one that was supposed to reestablish communications between Alaska Airlines and the SABRE system. Alaska Airlines and SABRE were unable to communicate for over five hours until Sprint finally got the first cable cut repaired.

Alaska and Horizon Air ended up having to cancel 78 flights, affecting nearly 7000 passengers in the process. Thousands more passengers were inconvenienced, as their flights were delayed up to four hours. In addition, an untold number of Sprint customers in California, Oregon, Minnesota, and Washington also lost service for several hours because of the cable cuts.

As of this morning, Sprint still hasn’t explained the reason for the second cable cut. Yesterday, Sprint said it could not rule out sabotage.

I would be happy to hear from someone who specializes in network reliability analysis who can tell me the odds of Alaska Airlines losing connectivity with SABRE by having these two exact cables being accidentally severed at nearly the same time.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Telecom,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,airport/port/customs/systems"
2012-10-01T07:00:00Z,Erroneous Trades Plunge India's National Stock Exchange 800 Points in Minutes, Trader enters 59 erroneous orders ; exchange stops to unravel orders ,,,15,minutes,0.25,,,,,India,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/algorithms-gone-wild,,Algorithms Gone Wild,"In what seems to be turning into a weekly event, reports are coming out of India today that 59 erroneous trades caused the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty index to plunge over 800 points in a few minutes, wiping out some $58 billion in value from the fourth largest market in Asia, Bloomberg News reported. Trading was suspended for about 15 minutes this morning until the erroneous trades could be straightened out.

According to an Indian Express story that quoted from an NSE statement, a trader at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd entered “59 erroneous orders which resulted in multiple trades for an aggregate value of over Rs 650 crore [about US $126 million]… These non-algo market orders have been entered for an erroneous quantity which resulted in executing trades at multiple price points across the entire order book thereby causing the [market] circuit filter to be triggered.”

Emkay was able to unravel the trades, and close out its position, the Express story stated. Its trading on the NSE was also disabled; Emkay’s own stock took a beating once the NSE resumed trading, dropping 10 percent, at which point trading in its stock was suspended.

Earlier this week, the NASDAQ had its own trading uffda, but this time caused by yet another trading algorithm gone wild. As told by the Wall Street Journal, some twenty seconds after the NASDAQ opened on Wednesday at 0930, “sales in Kraft's shares bounced back and forth between levels that were more than $7 apart, without hitting any prices in between. That gulf, known as the ‘bid-ask spread,’ was far wider than those typically seen in stocks like Kraft.” This all occurred in a span of 5 seconds, which, as the WSJ stated, is “a long stretch in a largely electronic market dominated by computers that measure trading times in millionths of a second.”

A story in the Financial Times of London reported that the NASDAQ determined within an hour that the trades were clearly erroneous and cancelled them. The trades also affected other exchanges, including NYSE Arca, Direct Edge, and BATS, which all agreed to cancel the trades.

The FT cited Eric Hunsader, chief executive of Nanex, a market data company as saying “the problem appeared to be an algorithm that was trying to buy 30,000 shares in Kraft but did not want to skew the market by buying them all at once. ‘The trades were spread out by milliseconds and look to have executed at 11 different trading venues.’ ”

The NASDAQ has declined to name the trading company involved or what action it is taking as a result. The most it would say that the exchange system worked as designed.

In a bit of irony, on Tuesday, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) hosted an industry-government roundtable of leading equity market participants to discuss the recent spate of high-frequency trading glitches. SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro said that so far, investigations in the glitches show that they are the result of “basic technology 101 issues.” Schapiro implied in her remarks aimed at industry that if these glitches continue and cause “collateral damage to investors and their confidence in the integrity and stability of our markets,” the SEC will take action that the exchanges and equity market participants won’t likely enjoy.

There was no comment by Schapiro on the Kraft trading glitch the day after her not so subtle warning to industry to get things sorted.","India,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Stock Exchanges,,Impact - Raw,stock exchanges"
2012-10-01T07:00:00Z,London Black Taxi Company Manganese Bronze Goes Bankrupt , Happens a few months after financial errors uncovered from moving to new accounting system in 2010 ,,,,,,,,,,UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/harley-davidson-survives-major-it-implementation-londons-black-taxi-company-not-so-lucky,true,Harley Davidson Survives Major IT Implementation; London’s Black Taxi Company Not So Lucky,"Back in 2009, iconic motorcycle company Harley Davidson began a painful restructuring of its manufacturing operations and work force in the face of weak consumer demand and nagging quality issues. One major element of its restructuring plan was a massive transformation of its York, Pennsylvania facility to increase its “factory customization, enable more flexible production and provide end-to-end supply chain integration.”

The effort was described CEO Keith Wandell in April 2011 as including the “retraining our entire workforce on a new operating system, outsourcing nearly 2000 non-core parts and subassemblies, moving and reconfiguring production lines, implementing a new ERP [enterprise resource planning] system and redefining our vehicle delivery process. The restructuring of our York facility is expected to be largely complete in the first half of next year [2012]. Through the next several quarters, we continue to expect York deficiencies will be adversely impacted by restructuring activities.”

The company had hoped to launch the ERP system in the early spring of this year, but in testing the system, Harley said it found “opportunities to improve the design of the system and reduce downtime during launch,” according to a Central Penn Business Journal story. In other words, it didn’t work as expected. The launch date was pushed back into July, a delay that was somewhat fortuitous because it meant that the ERP launch was not going to take place during the height of this spring’s selling season, and instead would support the company’s transition to the 2013 model year, albeit that delay would affect bike production as well.

Yesterday, Harley Davidson announced that it had earned $134 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30, down from $183.6 million for the same quarter last year, due to the York ERP launch over the summer. However, the launch was successful, the company said, although it will likely take the next several months to fully optimize the system. The news, along with an increase in Harley international sales, sent the company stock up some 7.6 percent while the rest of the market took a beating.

Elsewhere in the automotive industry, however, the news is bleaker. Manganese Bronze, the maker of the iconic London black taxi, announced this week that it was going into administration—normally the U.K. version of U.S. bankruptcy law's Chapter 11, but in this case, probably its death knell. As I noted a few months ago, a new accounting system installed in 2010 missed some key transactions during the cut-over and led to an understatement of £3.9 million in historical losses, which weren’t discovered until recently. The company, which has been under strong competitive pressure, saw a massive sell-off of its already weakened stock.

Then a few weeks ago, the company announced a recall of 400 of its latest TX4 model taxis due to a steering box defect. The announcement forced the company to suspend trading in its shares.

Support System (ECSS) ", Air Force admits that effort produced no significant military capability ,,,,,,,1.0E9,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/military/us-air-force-blows-1-billion-on-failed-erp-project,,U.S. Air Force Blows $1 Billion on Failed ERP Project,"The U.S. Department of Defense latest strategy for putting lipstick on a pig, when faced with a major project debacle, has been to say, “Well, it’s not a total waste because the effort creates an opportunity to harvest technologies and lessons learned.” I expect to see the same lipstick strategy, maybe in a new shade, from the U.S. Air Force regarding its Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS), which it finally decided to scrap after blowing through a billion dollars over seven years of development to produce a system which it admits as having no “significant military capability,” Defense World reported late last week.

The ECSS project (pdf) began in 2004 as an ambitious and risky effort to replace 240 outdated Air Force computer systems with a single integrated system so that the Air Force could finally come up with an auditable set of financial records, something I don’t think it has been ever able to do since its creation as a separate branch of the military in 1947. The decision to trash the ECSS system is of no great surprise, except for why it took so long.

Back in April, the Air Force's comptroller, Jamie Morin, told the Senate Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support that, “We're now approaching seven years since funds were first expended on this system. The total cost is now over US $1 billion. I'm personally appalled at the limited capabilities that program has produced relative to that amount of investment.”

Morin went on to explain to the Senate what the Air Force was going to do next in regard to ECSS and how it was going to achieve the objective of having auditable financials by 2017. This was going to be a challenge since in March, the Air Force had terminated the ECSS contract with prime contractor CSC for performance reasons. This followed on from a stop work order that had been issued to CSC in September of last year for a lack of progress. Since then, the Air Force has been trying to figure out how to once again restructure the project (it had been restructured at least twice before) in hopes of finding that elusive path to success.

Apparently, however, after a thorough analysis, the Air Force determined that there wasn't a feasible or affordable path to success available. Continuing the program, it determined, “would have cost an estimated $1.1 billion for about one-quarter of the original scope, with fielding delayed until 2020,” Defense World said.

Why, you might ask, didn’t the U.S. Air Force leadership take action to keep ECSS from turning into a billion dollar debacle? The reasons are explained well in a 2011 Institute for Defense Analysis report (pdf) on why DoD ERP projects are routinely “over budget, behind schedule, and have not met performance expectations.”

In the report, IDA states that on these projects, “Program managers are unable to deliver a completely factual version of their status to leadership if it contains any element that could be considered significantly negative. To do so is perceived as weakness in execution even though the root causes may be out of the control of the program manager. Program managers fear that an honest delivery of program status will result in cancellation. As a result of this, leadership is unable to be effective in removing obstacles to program success.”

In short, no one in the DoD leadership chain wants to hear bad news. The IDA report further noted that bringing up bad news required “courage,” which apparently is in short supply in DoD ERP projects in particular and, from my experience, DoD programs in general.

Avantor Sues IBM, Claims Fraud

In another ERP-related debacle story this week, Avantor Performance Materials, a global manufacturer of high-performance chemistries and materials, announced in a press release that it was filing suit against IBM for a failed SAP software implementation. Avantor alleges that IBM, which was retained by Avantor to upgrade its global computer systems to an SAP platform,"" fraudulently misrepresented the capabilities of its proprietary software solution and engaged in other misconduct leading to a failed implementation in Avantor’s U.S. locations.""

The press release quotes John Steitz, President and CEO of Avantor, as saying, “IBM representatives assured us that its Express Life Sciences Solution, a prepackaged software solution, was suitable to run Avantor’s core business processes. In fact, the solution—and the service and support offered by IBM throughout the implementation—proved to be woefully misaligned with the unique needs of our company and our customers.”

The company claims that it has spent the last seven months recovering from the effects of the failed SAP implementation, and wants tens of millions of dollars in damages from IBM as a result.

A Reuters story says that IBM was surprised by the lawsuit, and that the complaints “are exaggerated and misguided.” It went on to say that IBM claimed that it had “met its contractual obligations and delivered a solution that Avantor continued to use in its operations,” a claim that the Avantor press release seems to contradict.

At least the IBM failed implementation failed quickly.","US,Project Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,ERP"

A few weeks ago, the London Telegraph published an interesting article about the remains of an Allied Forces carrier pigeon found during the recent renovation of a homeowner’s chimney in Bletchingley, Surrey, England. The bird's skeletal remains still had a coded message encased in a red capsule attached to one of its legs. The message, the Telegraph stated, was “almost certainly dispatched from Nazi-occupied France on 6 June 1944—during the D-Day invasions.”

The Telegraph noted that carrier pigeons were used to inform Allied military commanders in England about how the D-Day operations were proceeding during the radio blackout which Churchill had imposed during the invasion. Over 250 000 such pigeons were used during the course of the war.

The coded message (pdf) was turned over to cryptographers working for the U.K. Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham. However, after a few weeks of trying, the government cryptographers admitted that they have been unable to break the code. A GCHQ press release explaining why the code remains undeciphered states that, ""GCHQ’s experts are now satisfied that the pigeon-borne message assumed to have been sent during the Second World War cannot be decoded without access to the original cryptographic material.""

GCHC cryptographers believe the code involved using a ""one-time"" pad. As explained in the press release, ""The basis of a 'one-time pad' encryption system is that a random key is used to encrypt (and subsequently decrypt) only one message. The advantage of this system is that, if used correctly, it is unbreakable as long as the key is kept secret. The disadvantage is that both the sending and receiving parties need to have access to the same key, which usually means producing and sharing a large keypad in advance.""

According to a Telegraph story from last week, GCHQ has publicly appealed to any retired codebreakers who worked at Bletchley Park or in military signals during the war to help break the code. Former members of the French resistance are also being contacted to see whether anyone still alive may know the code's key. The Telegraph has invited the public to try to solve the coded message as well. If you feel so inclined, send your answers to mynews@telegraph.co.uk – you might win a copy of the Telegraph’s All New Toughie Crossword Book. I suspect, though, if you can crack the code, the crossword book probably won't be much of a challenge.

Unlike last year, Black Friday and the following weekend's online sales suffered few disruptions. On Monday of last week, Best Buy’s “website failed to calculate some of the sales taxes on the Black Friday specials that it offers online ahead of time for its Reward Zone customers,” a story in the Pioneer Press reported. Things were straightened out by the next day. Click Frenzy, Australia's take on today’s Black Monday—when U.S. retailers offer online discounts on electronic merchandise—had a rough start. The group's website, which hosted virtual storefronts for dozens of Aussie retailers, was overwhelmed by heavy demand. Though the site crashed soon after it opened for business, it was able to recover a few hours later—but not before Click Frenzy organizers received a bashing in the Australian press.

No major Black Monday IT glitches are being reported thus far today.

Early last week, departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) across the United States were affected for several days by a database problem originating at the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. That group keeps up to date information used by a state's DMV to verify the information on a driver wanting to exchange an out of state driver's license for one it issues. The database, which kept crashing, reportedly caused long lines at DMVs in Georgia and Nevada, among others.

An IT glitch associated with a change in Canada’s Citizenship and Immigration computers granted permanent residency visas to some 50 immigrants and members of their families even though they were no longer eligible, the Vancouver Sun reported Wednesday. Luckily for them, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney decided that because it was an “administrative error” on the part of his department, he would allow the 50 to stay in Canada. They probably wouldn’t have been so lucky if they had been moving to the U.S. under the same circumstances.

Finally, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that university scientists working aboard the RV Southern Surveyor, Australia's Marine National Facility research ship, had “undiscovered” an island. Apparently, Sandy Island is shown on marine charts – and Google Earth – as a large island sitting between Australia and New Caledonia in the south Pacific. However, when the scientists sailed to the charted location of Sandy Island, it was nowhere to be found.

The Herald noted that Sandy Island has appeared in scientific publications since at least the year 2000 without anyone reporting its non-existence. Google, in its defense, said that it “consulted a variety of authoritative public and commercial data sources in building its maps.” However, the Herald said, the company “encouraged users to alert Google to incorrect entries using the 'Report a Problem' tool… which they would then confirm with other users or data providers.”

If I interpret that correctly, Google doesn’t quite believe the Australian university scientists’ word that Sandy Island doesn’t exist. It still apparently needs the island’s non-existence confirmed by others before it will delete it.","US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Transportation,,,Impact - Raw"
2012-12-01T07:00:00Z,Vermont and HP Settle Over Failed Dept. of Motor Vehicle Project," Project cost was $18 Million; HP refunds state $8.4 Million, making state's cost $9.6 Million ",,,,,,,1.8E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Transportation,,http://vtdigger.org/2012/12/05/state-wins-8-37-million-back-from-hp-for-failed-dmv-system/,,State wins $8.37 million back from HP for failed DMV system,"The state reached a settlement with Hewlett-Packard over a failed computer project at the Department of Motor Vehicles on Wednesday, winning an $8.37 million refund from the company for its failure to deliver on a new driver data system.

Under the settlement, the state will return to HP physical and virtual rights to all software and documents created by the company, but will retain some of HP’s other materials, such as a retail sales system, along with other equipment and printers.

The DMV’s VT DRIVES project was started in 2006 and cost the state $18 million in total. Shumlin administration officials said the contract governing the project was flawed, and mutual termination was the best way to resolve ongoing issues.

DMV Commissioner Robert Ide hailed the settlement as a victory.

“A refund of $8.37 million looks like a pretty big number in my world,” Ide said. The refund represents almost all of the $9 million paid to HP. The other $9 million in project costs includes about $5 million for staff time and expenses, and about $4 million for usable products HP provided.

Both Ide and Jeb Spaulding, the secretary of the Agency of Administration, said negotiations went smoothly. Spaulding said Gov. Peter Shumlin’s personal involvement in the talks since the winter of 2011 made a key difference.

“I think it made a difference that he [Shumlin] was personally adamant about getting some refund, and wanted ultimately, all of our money back,” said Spaulding. “I guess it pays to have a governor who is hands-on.”

HP press spokesman Bill Ritz declined to comment on the settlement.

Spaulding said HP deserves credit for giving the state refund.

“They probably took the bigger picture, that they are a good corporate citizen, and that there’s plenty of other business here in Vermont, both public and private,” said Spaulding, of HP. “By doing ‘the right thing’ in the long run, they’d be better off.”

An HP subsidiary has held the contract for the state’s Medicaid billing system since 1992.

Ide said $5 million on staff expenses was not wasted, and the DMV received some value for another $2.7 million in expenditures.

“When you’re knee-deep on a project of this size, to get a refund like that is about as good as you can hope for,” said Ide. “This has been imperfect for a long time.”

Ide said four different firms handled the same contract over the years, as each became acquired by a larger technology company. That, and staff turnover at both the vendor and DMV, compounded a major technical disagreement. HP refused to redesign a system code that the DMV viewed as fatally flawed.

The DMV will revert to its legacy computer system, which has been in service for 35 years. Ide said improvements had been made to that system in the meantime, and that he isn’t overly worried about replacing it immediately.

Ide says he’ll wait to see if another state successfully installs a data driver system first.

“Certainly there are risks in those old legacy systems, but the bigger risk would be to start undertaking a project that you weren’t prepared for, and didn’t have the capacity to execute on,” Spaulding said.

Spaulding couldn’t say whether the administration was involved in helping the state’s Judiciary with similar ongoing negotiations over its suspended $4.3 million IT contract for an online case management system, though he confirmed that Shumlin wasn’t personally involved in those negotiations. It isn’t clear whether a refund will be the best solution in that case, Spaulding said.

View a copy of the settlement here, and the original independent review of the project done by the state’s IT department, done in 2005.

The news about the HP settlement was released the day after VTDigger published a 4,400 word analysis of the state’s $90 million in IT spending from 2005 to 2012 on general government projects, including VTDRIVES, the failed case management system for the judiciary, a timesheet accounting system for state employees, an $18 million online gaming system, a tax program, among others.","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Transportation,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency"
2012-12-01T07:00:00Z,Amazon Cloud Issue Takes Down NetFlix on Christmas Eve, Amazon blames thunderstorms ,,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,IT,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/it-hiccups-of-the-week-amazons-christmas-eves-incident-hits-netflix-,true,IT Hiccups of the Week: Amazon’s Christmas Eve Incident Hits Netflix,"Luckily, there have been rather few IT uff das over the holiday season. That said, there were still a few worth noting.

The world’s stock exchanges continued their streak of glitches over the last year with one at the New York Stock Exchange ending 2012 and two new ones to start 2013, one at the Nasdaq and the other at the London Stock Exchange, which served to undercut the exchanges’ promises to reduce operational snafus.

Netflix experienced two glitches, one at the hands of Amazon on Christmas Eve and one of their own making. At about 12:30 PST on Christmas Eve, Netflix’s streaming video went out for customers across Canada, Latin America, and the United States and wasn’t fully restored until late Christmas morning. Netflix placed the blame on a problem with Amazon’s Web Services (AWS) cloud computing center in Northern Virginia, which Amazon admitted experienced an “event” on 24 December. Amazon, in a long and detailed explanation, said that the root cause of the error was a programmer doing system maintenance who accidentally logically deleted “a portion of the ELB [Elastic Load Balancing] state data.” It took a couple of hours before the accident showed up in a way that it could be diagnosed correctly and then many more before an effective fix took hold. Other Amazon AWS users were also affected by the incident, but given that it was Christmas Eve, there weren’t wide-spread complaints reported.

Amazon apologized for the incident, and claimed that it would “use it to drive further improvement” in its services. Netflix also apologized for the outage, explaining how it had thought it had built in enough redundancy to handle such an incident. In a backhand swipe at Amazon’s vaunted claims for it cloud’s service reliability, Netflix said, “It is still early days for cloud innovation and there is certainly more to do in terms of building resiliency in the cloud,” and would be investigating further approaches on how to improve its reliability.

The other Netflix problem occurred on New Year’s Eve. In this case, the “technical difficulties” didn’t affect streaming video but the capability of some Netflix customers to add discs to their mailing queue. Apparently the minor issue was fixed by New Year’s Day.

A more impactful technical difficulty was felt in Michigan when the state’s Department of Technology, Management and Budget (DTMB) to load food assistance benefits on state-issued debit cards at the beginning of the year, the AP reported. It happened because of a “human error” in which a the department “failed to give a vendor a computer file required”. Some 85 000 food assistance recipients out of 1.8 million were affected; those affected had identification numbers ending in “0,” “1,” and “2,” television station CBS Detroit reported. The situation was fixed by noon on Saturday, and the DTMB promised to “find out why exactly this happened” and “figure out how to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”

A similar “forgot to load the data” excuse was pointed to as the reason why some Augusta, Georgia city employees discovered that their Blue Cross Blue Shield of Georgia health insurance cards were showing up as being invalid on New Year’s Day. According to a story at the Augusta Chronicle, “Mike Blanchard, the deputy information technology director … said [in an email to city employees] the problem was caused when … [an] employee benefits file failed to load into the Blue Cross system.” The insurance policy was still valid, but until new cards were mailed out sometime this week, “employees should present a copy of an attached letter at the doctor’s office and pharmacy and have the office call Blue Cross or pharmacy services for confirmation.”

The Chronicle reported that city employees weren't happy, especially given that, “City officials offered similar explanations when hundreds of Augusta employees’ and retirees’ insurance previously turned up canceled,” last year.

Finally, there was an AP report that those dependent on unemployment benefits in Arizona wouldn’t have to wait for their checks after all. The Arizona Department of Economic Security had warned benefit recipients that the late decision by the U.S. government to extend unemployment benefits as part of the “fiscal cliff” agreement might delay unemployment checks for up to a week because of the computer programming changes required. However, the AP reported, the programming changes were completed ahead of schedule and no delay would result.

A programming change done ahead of schedule? Almost sounds like as A Christmas Carol ending.","US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,IT,,Impact - Raw"

We start off with the lingering after-effects of the grounding of the USS Guardian on a Philippine reef—which we first noted a few weeks ago.

U.S. Navy Decides to Scrap Minesweeper Stuck on Ecologically Sensitive Philippine Reef

On 17 January, the U.S. Navy minesweeper USS Guardian ran hard aground on a reef within the protected Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park in Philippine waters where it remains stuck. A preliminary assessment indicates that the ship was following a National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency-supplied Coastal Digital Nautical Chart (DNC) that “misplaced the location of a reef by about eight nautical miles.” The reef is located in a UNESCO World Heritage restricted zone, and any damage caused to the reef is heavily fined.

The Navy had hoped that it could wrestle the USS Guardian free without too much damage to the reef or the ship, but those hopes were dashed when the 23-year-old wooden-hulled ship started taking on water. As a result, the Navy decided that the best option was to dismantle the ship and remove it as three separate sections. A floating crane from Singapore is being brought in to help with the ship’s removal.

An interesting story last week at the website Maritime Accident Casebook indicates that the navigational snafu has been attributed to human error at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). According to the story, the NGA decided to update its navigational charts in 2008 using LANDSAT-derived imagery because of the age and uncertainty of information shown on the nautical charts in that area of the Pacific (some dating back to 1940 and 1942, an earlier MA Casebook article says). Some of the old charts even indicated the presence of “phantom islands.”

Quoting an NGA spokesperson, “One of these images included incorrect information about the location of the section of ocean that includes the Tubbataha Reef. At the time, no other source information existed to validate that imagery data. As a result, the reef was incorrectly placed in the DNC.”

Then, in 2011, the NGA became aware of the error, and corrected all the charts except one: that being the one for the area around the Tubbataha Reef. According to the NGA, this was a result of “a failure to follow established procedure.”

In the wake of the incident, the NGA has reexamined charts covering “more than 116 million square nautical miles of ocean” and found only one other error of a “magnitude similar to the misplacement of the Tubbataha Reef.” That one corresponded to an area off the coast of Chile. Mariners have been warned of the discrepancy.

The Navy expects that it will take about a month to remove the USS Guardian. The fine to be levied is unknown, but it is likely to be substantial. The political price may be substantial as well.

Technical Issues Hit Amazon, Bank of America, PayPal and Twitter

A cluster of IT glitches last week hit some well-known companies. First, on Monday, there were reports that PayPal customers ended up being charged multiple times for their transactions over a period of about three hours. PayPal has strongly denied The Register's claims the problem lasted 15 hours. A story at FierceCIO says that the multiple-charge problem was the result of instant payment notifications that were delayed in being sent back to customers. The delay caused many customers to think their PayPal transactions didn’t go through, causing them to make one or more additional payments. PayPal says that, “All customers will be refunded for duplicate transactions as soon as possible.”

Then on Thursday, Amazon suffered a 49-minute outage that made its homepage inaccessible, although it said that its other pages were fine. Amazon has been closed-mouthed about what caused the outage, other than to say it wasn’t hacked nor was it a problem with its cloud. It has been estimated that the cost to the company will be around $5 million in lost revenue.

Also on Thursday, Twitter said in a message to its users that there were “intermittent issues affecting Web and mobile users, globally, between approximately 7:00am and 9:50am PST.” The message went on to say that, “We apologize to users who were affected by this, and we’re working to ensure that similar issues do not occur.” The message did not say what those issues were.

In an apparently unrelated matter, Twitter then announced Friday that it had “discovered one live [security] attack and were able to shut it down in process moments later. However, our investigation has thus far indicated that the attackers may have had access to limited user information—usernames, email addresses, session tokens and encrypted/salted versions of passwords—for approximately 250,000 users.”

As a precaution, Twitter has “reset passwords and revoked session tokens for these accounts.” Affected users will be receiving an email asking them to reset their passwords; if you get one, just be careful it isn’t phish.

Also on Friday, Bank of America said that its electronic banking operations and telephone call centers were inaccessible. The Washington Post reported that the problem was caused by unexplained “technical issues” rather than a cyber attack. And according to a story at the BBC which coincidentally was published on Friday, no one should be surprised by similar outages at other banks this year because of the ever increasing complexity of banking software.

Another Week, Another Stock Market Gaffe

This week’s stock market gaffe happened Friday on India's National Stock Exchange. In this case, an error in the software being used by the brokerage Religare Capital Markets Ltd. caused TaTa Motors' stock price to fall by 10 percent. Religare was quoted by Bloomberg News as saying, “Due to some technical issue in the software, unintended transactions got executed.”

Bloomberg said that the error will likely cost the brokerage some 100 million rupees (around US $1.8 million).

Last year you may recall there was another trading glitch that caused the National Stock Exchange (NSE) Nifty index to plunge over 800 points in a few minutes, wiping out some $58 billion in value from the fourth largest market in Asia.

Saving London’s Iconic Black Cabs – At Least for Now

Finally, last October, I noted that Manganese Bronze, the maker of the iconic London black taxi, announced that it was going into administration—the U.K. version of U.S. bankruptcy law's Chapter 11. The reason was an accounting error that went unseen for over two years when the company switched to new accounting software. The result: the company understated by £3.9 million its historical losses. Given the poor economic health of the company and the intense competition in London’s taxi market, Manganese Bronze stock took a nosedive when the accounting error became public. It looked like only a matter of time before the company, which was then worth roughly £5 million, would go belly up.

Fortunately, last week, Chinese car manufacturer company Zhejiang Geely, which already owned 20 percent of Manganese Bronze, decided to buy the rest of the company and its assets for £11.04 million “through a newly established British subsidiary, Geely UK,” the London Telegraph reported. The new owners say they are “confident” the business will be profitable within three years.

I hope so. London wouldn’t really be the same without those black taxis.

Secretary Shinseki and Secretary Panetta have just concluded another joint meeting, their ninth such meeting of the last 18 months. Their close working relationship is a testament to their shared commitment to taking on the common issues that affect our departments.

At this point, I'd like to welcome Secretary Shinseki and Secretary Panetta.

SECRETARY ERIC SHINSEKI: Good afternoon, everybody. Am I on, Tom?

(FACILITATOR): You're up.

SECRETARY SHINSEKI: Well, good afternoon, afternoon. I'm personally very proud to have this opportunity to be able to thank my friend, Secretary Leon Panetta, for his many years of devoted public service, dedicated specifically to taking care of the men and women who wear on nation's uniforms and for those who in years past have worn those same uniforms.

We just concluded our ninth meeting, I believe, in 18 months. As always, you come out of these meetings great things accomplished, but more work to do, and that will always be true. But with the president's leadership and guidance, we have brought our two departments much closer together, closer than ever before. And that's good for our people.

We had previously indicated our commitment of both of our departments to a single, common, joint integrated electronic health record, the IEHR. And today we affirm again our commitment to achieving the president's goal in 2014.

Today's meeting was about how to get there and, in the short term, we've agreed to improve data interoperability to that integrated electronic health record before the end of this year, by standardizing health care data no later than December 2013, creating health data authoritative source no later than September of 2013, accelerating the exchange of real-time data between V.A. and DOD no later than December of 2013, and allowing V.A. and DOD patients to download their medical records, what we call our Blue Button Initiative, no later than May of 2013, and, finally, upgrading the graphical user interface, this thing we call the GUI, to display the new standardized V.A. and DOD health care data no later than December of 2013, all of this focused on an initial operating capability in 2014.

We've also approved plans to expand the use of the Janus graphical user interface, the GUI, to seven additional sites and its expansion of two DOD sites no later than July 2013. And then, finally, we'll select a core of -- core set of IEHR capabilities no later than March of 2013. All of these milestones enable achievement of the president's goal in 2014.

Secretary Panetta and I have been working side by side for 18 months now to ensure servicemembers and veterans receive the care they've earned. And I just want to extend my thanks once again to the secretary for his leadership and his partnership, and as I've said several times before, even in testimony, the veterans couldn't have a stronger ally in their corner than Leon Panetta.

So with that, Mr. Secretary?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE LEON E. PANETTA: Thank you very much. Thanks, Ric, and good afternoon to everybody.

It is, as always, a great pleasure to be back here at the Department of Veterans Affairs and to have a chance to discuss the new steps our departments are taking to integrate electronic health records on an accelerated basis. Upfront, let me take this opportunity to deeply thank you, Ric, for your cooperation, for your friendship, and for your great willingness to work with us during the time that I've been secretary of defense. Ric is an outstanding leader. He served his country with distinction. And it's been my great pleasure to have the opportunity to continue to work with him in this job.

We've met on a regular basis. We've had a number of meetings. And, you know, some of them have been pretty tough meetings. But we are grateful that progress is being made towards a common goal of trying to support those in uniform and their families. There's no distinction here between veterans and those who serve in uniform. We're talking about the same individuals who serve this country. And that's what we've tried to do with the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, is to recognize that we both serve the same individuals who put their lives on the line for this country.

Achieving the goal has taken a tremendous amount of collaboration at all levels. But I'm proud to say that our departments are now working together more closely than ever before. We recognize that bringing together two large bureaucracies, trying to make those bureaucracies work together to form a seamless support system for all service members and veterans is not an easy challenge. It's tough. But we also know how important it is to cut through the regulations and the red tape and deliver quality services for our troops, for our veterans and to their families. Ric and I have always said that this cannot be about turf, this cannot be about turf, this has to be about what's best in serving our veterans.

One of the most complex challenges we face is, obviously, the whole issue of health records. Our service members often have extensive records. The last thing they need is to worry about their doctors having all of the information that they need in order to provide them the care that they deserve. That's the last thing they ought to worry about.

It's frustrating. It's been inefficient for service members to have to hand-deliver records from one system to another when they get out of the military. It doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense. As President Obama directed in 2009, we can and we must do better. And that means improving the quality and availability and interoperability of our health record systems.

As you know, our two departments have been moving toward a plan to build a single customized, integrated electronic health record system from the ground up, to meet the president's directive and modernize our legacy IT systems. Our goal had been to complete this effort by 2017. I think over the last few months, Ric and I both have recognized that, you know, our worry is, how long is it going to take to get to that goal? And what is going to be the price tag to get to that goal? And how many times is it going to be delayed?

So we asked the managers of the joint program to take a step back, take a step back and assess whether we could achieve the president's directive much sooner and for much less money than had been budgeted. With advantages in technology, thank God, and the work that our two agencies have already done, it turned out that we could.

So today, Ric and I agreed to make a series of important changes to simplify this program, cut costs, and to get our veterans the key benefits of this new system much sooner. Rather than building a single integrated system from scratch, we will focus our immediate efforts on integrating V.A. and DOD health data as quickly as possible, by focusing on interoperability and using existing solutions.

This approach is affordable, it's achievable, and if we refocus our efforts, we believe we can achieve the key goal of a seamless system for health records between V.A. and DOD on a greatly accelerated schedule. We're now directing our departments to do just that.

We've already identified ways to standardize V.A. health data and align it with DOD data. It's not an easy task, but it's making good progress, and it's been done by both agencies. And we are continuing enhancements, as Ric pointed out, on the so-called Blue Button effort that will allow doctors and patients to access health records at any DOD or V.A. facility.

By this summer, DOD and V.A. will field and begin conducting a pilot program on the common interface for doctors at seven joint rehab centers across the country and we'll also expand its use at two other sites. All of these facilities will be interoperable by the end of July 2013, so fast time track, but we think we can get it done.

By January of 2014, we will meet the president's directive for standardizing and aligning data in a way that enables both V.A. and DOD beneficiaries to download their own health information. The bottom line is this, that we now have a clear and achievable path to meet the president's directive to implement the seamless electronic health record system for our troops and for our veterans.

Coming out of a decade of war, we owe it to the service members and veterans to do everything we can to help them succeed in life after the military. That includes helping them prepare for the transition at the Department of Defense and giving them the information and support that they need when they come home or leave the military.

This is a struggle. This is a struggle that has gone on for a long number of years. Some have argued that we should build a perfect system. Some argued that we'll never be able to do this. But for the first time, both DOD and V.A. have come together to say we can get this done, we can get it done in an effective way that does the job and does it in an expeditious way in order to make sure that we best serve our veterans and we best serve those who put their lives on the line. I'm proud to be able to make this announcement today, because I believe that both departments has met the challenge that the president has given us to try to do everything possible to try to put the health care systems of both these departments together for the benefit of our troops. Thank you.
The departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have spent at least $1.3 billion during the last four years in an unsuccessful effort to develop an interoperable electronic health record system, according to an investigation by News21, the Center for Public Integrity reports (Winston, Center for Public Integrity, 8/27).

Background

DOD and VA first launched an effort to create a joint integrated EHR, or iEHR system, in 2009. The iEHR project aimed to allow every service member to maintain a single EHR throughout his or her career and lifetime.

However, DOD and VA officials in February announced plans to halt the iEHR project and instead focus on making their current EHR systems more interoperable.

During a congressional budget hearing in April, VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said that his agency is moving forward with plans to share EHR data with DOD. VA plans to use its existing VistA EHR system as its core platform and encouraged DOD to also adopt the VistA EHR system.

DOD Secretary Chuck Hagel in a memo obtained by NextGov wrote that the agency will consider a commercial EHR system as part of its efforts to establish an integrated EHR program with VA.

In June, lawmakers introduced a bill (HR 2590) that would require the two departments to establish interoperability between their EHR systems within 180 days of the bill's enactment (iHealthBeat, 7/24).

DOD, VA Financing Independent Technology Upgrades

According to the News21 investigation, the departments have allocated funds to establish independent upgrades to their existing systems. VA plans to invest $12 billion over the course of five years on a project -- called ""Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology,"" or T4 -- to update its technologies, including upgrades to interoperable software that can be used between VA and DOD.

However, contract data obtained by News21 show that VA began paying companies for the project in July 2011, at which time both VA and DOD also were spending money to develop the iEHR. About one year before the agencies abandoned the iEHR project, VA awarded an $80.3 million multi-year contract to Harris Corporation to create software that allows the two agencies to communicate.

Meanwhile, the DOD's 2014 budget requests $466.9 million for ""replacement and modernization"" and ""initial outfitting"" of its current EHR system (Center for Public Integrity, 8/27).","US,Project Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"
2013-02-01T07:00:00Z,California Cancels $89.7 Million MyCalPAYS Payroll Modernization System , $50 Million spent but 5 Phase system development never made it past Phase 1  ,,,,,,,5.0E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/californias-payroll-project-debacle-another-50-million-up-in-smoke,,California’s Payroll Project Debacle: Another $50 Million Up in Smoke,"Ah, I love the smell of napalmed IT projects in the morning!

Not, though, when they are government IT projects and the wafting odor is from taxpayer monies going up in smoke. And unfortunately, for past few weeks, the stench of burning government IT projects has been especially pungent.

We start off in California, where after burning through some $50 million, California State Controller John Chiang announced last Friday he had decided to terminate the state’s US $89.7 million contract “with SAP as the system integrator for the MyCalPAYS system, the largest payroll modernization effort in the nation.” The planned 5-phase effort mercifully never made it past the first pilot phase.

Furthermore, Chiang said that the Secretary of the California Technology Agency (CTA) has “suspended further work until the CTA and SCO [State Controller’s Office] together conduct an independent assessment of SAP’s system to determine whether any of SAP’s work can be used in the SCO’s go-forward plan to address the State’s business needs.”

You may remember that Chiang sent SAP a letter last October warning that the project was “foundering and is in danger of collapsing,” and gave SAP one last chance in the form of a demand for urgent get-well efforts from the company. Chiang claimed that there were errors in one out of every three tasks performed by SAP's system, and that there hadn’t been a single pay cycle without material payroll errors occurring.

In Friday’s announcement, Chiang threw in the towel. He said that while he had hoped “for a successful cure to SAP’s failure to deliver an accurate, stable, reliable payroll system, SAP has not demonstrated an ability to do so.” This was especially disheartening, Chiang implied, given that the SAP effort covered only 1300 SCO employees who had “fairly simple payroll requirements.” There was no way the SAP system could be trusted to support the payroll requirements of the state's ""240 000 employees, operating out of 160 different departments, under 21 different bargaining units.""

SAP said in response to the news of its contract termination that it was “extremely disappointed in the actions. SAP stands behind our software and actions.... SAP also believes we have satisfied all contractual obligations in this project.”

All of this, of course, suggests that when the napalm smoke clears, a date in court will be in the offing. Chiang as much as said so in the announcement: “The SCO will pursue every contractual and legal option available to hold SAP accountable for its failed performance and to protect the interests of the State and its taxpayers. This includes contractually required mediation and, if necessary, litigation.”

An SCO spokesperson called the project’s performance “frightening,” but what must be really frightening to California taxpayers is the continued inability of the state to manage the acquisition of its IT projects. So far, nearly $254 million has been spent so far in two unsuccessful attempts to get a state government payroll system in place, the LA Times reports. If SAP fights instead of settles, it would at least be a public service, exposing the depth of California’s IT project risk mismanagement.

The upshot is that California will continue to use its decades-old Cobol-based payroll system until it figures out what to do next. And to help it figure that out, the SCO has—in the best tradition of government—set up an IT Procurement Task Force. Whenever in doubt, form a committee.

I hope the Task Force members have strong stomachs; the stench of IT project failure coming out of California is of the mephitis variety.

UN’s Umoja Project Failure of Management

If you see another cloud of smoke on the horizon, it's not Vatican, announcing the new pope. It's too early for that, and the cloud is way too large. It's the UN’s troubled enterprise resource project dubbed Umoja (or “unity” in Swahili) that is supposed “to equip the organization with twenty-first century techniques, tools, training and technology.” Fox News reported on Monday that it's going to burn though a lot more money before it is completed, assuming it ever is.

The project’s cost has climbed from an original US $286 million in 2008 to $316 million in 2009 and now looks like it will reach at least $348 million by 2015, “with three years still to go after that,” Fox reports. The completion dates have climbed with the dollars: The project was supposed to be delivered in 2012, but the current forecast go live date has slipped from 2015 to now December 2018. The likelihood of achieving that date is probably close to zero.

According to the Fox News story, even after promises in 2009 to follow accepted IT project management practices in the light of project problems that had already surfaced back then, UN auditors have found the project does not have “systems in place that could link the budget to milestones and deliverables.” In fact, the project management team told what had to be startled auditors that “linking the budget milestones and deliverables was not a requirement under the United Nations system accounting standards.”

The auditors must have felt that they had to go back and reread what their job description was after that revelation.

Next, the auditors found that the Umoja project team has not yet planned on how it will move legacy system data into the new system; auditors estimate this effort alone could tack at least another $110 million onto the project. Nor has the project team started to fulfill another promise made back in 2009 of ensuring “effective and ongoing education and training in both the new system but also all the new processes and standards that are going to be required.” The approach that the project team appears to have decided on, the auditors discovered, is to roll out the new system and hope its every feature and function is self-evident to the user.

I wonder what the Swahili word is for unmitigated IT project conflagration.

US Army Business Systems Implementations Worry DoD OIG

There's an IT disaster cloud forming over the Pentagon as well, and it may eventually dwarf the others. The Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General published a report last week that shows grave problems in the Army Office of Business Transformation (OBT).

In a review of the OBT business systems information technology strategy that is supposed to guide the implementation of Army IT systems worth some $10.1 billion over their life-cycle, the OIG found that the OBT’s overall strategy “did not include specific ERP [enterprise resource management] implementation milestones and performance measures for accomplishing the Strategy’s goals, [for example] including a plan for using ERP capabilities, or clearly define the Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program’s ERP integration role or milestones.” Sound familiar? It's as if OBT had decided to follow the UN's IT project management best practices.

The reason for the lack of specific ERP implementation milestones and performance measures, the OIG report stated, was that “OBT officials [were too] focused on near-term milestones.” OBT officials must not have been focusing too hard, however, given the OIG also found that “although OBT officials included 25 implementation tasks in the Strategy, with due dates of May 2011 and August 2011, the Army did not complete 16 of these tasks as of March 2012. This occurred because OBT officials did not adequately monitor the development and completion of the implementation tasks.”

Army leadership promised the OIG that it is its “intention” to start practicing IT project management 101, but things might change because “Army business system strategies and processes are changing rapidly and frequently due to both internal and external influences.”

In other words, the OBT’s intentions might soon be OBE (overtaken by events).

USAF ECSS Billion Dollar Debacle: We Don’t Believe in Accountability

Last Saturday, NBC Nightly News ran another one of its “Fleecing of America” segments on US governmental waste. This episode (video) involved the burnt-out wreck of the USAF Expeditionary Combat Support System, one of my favorite IT project debacles—it has managed to scorch through $1 billion with absolutely nothing to show for it. While the NBC News segment didn’t have much new to say, it did highlight the facts that: (a) the primary contractor CSC is still insisting that “it provided the Air Force with capabilities and assets to deliver the system of the future and that taxpayers got their money's worth” for the billion dollars spent, and that (b) no one will be fired or even punished over the debacle.

When Sen. John McCain was asked by NBC reporter Lisa Myers, “Should people be fired over this?” McCain answered, “Sure. Sure they should be. Will they be? No.”

In fact, Brig. Gen. Kathryn J. Johnson (who took over the project in May 2012) made it very clear that firing or even demoting anyone for blowing a billion dollars of taxpayers’ money was out of the question. In an interview with the Federal Times last November, when she was “asked if anyone has been fired or demoted for the program’s failure, Johnson said no. ‘We didn’t feel it was necessary to do that,’ she added.”

Maybe NBC Nightly News might want to interview Gen. Johnson and ask why the $%#$ not? And, at what point should some heads roll? Two billion? Ten billion? Or is managerial incompetence just part of the job description?

The Wall Street Journal ran a story last week on the USAF’s replacement for ECSS, which is supposed to be implemented by 2017. Not surprisingly, the Gen. Johnson refuses to state how much this replacement system will cost, but she does claim that it will cost less than ECSS.

My question: Is that cost in comparison to the original $668 million cost of ECSS or the nearly $8 billion that it would have taken to complete ECSS to its original specifications?

Marin County Settles Lawsuit and Ensures It Can’t Talk About Its Own Incompetence

Did you think we were done talking about failed California government IT projects? California and SAP—yes, SAP again!—have an apparently inexhaustible supply of them. You may recall one from 2009, involving Marin County’s MERIT (Marin Enterprise Resource Integrated Technology) system. The county had originally thought in 2005 that the MERIT system would cost it US $12 million, but the county ended up spending nearly $30 million over four years in a vain attempt to get the system to meet the county's original specifications before finally giving up.

In 2010, the county sued consulting company Deloitte Consulting LLP for $30 million along with unspecified punitive damages over what it claims was a botched SAP ERP implementation. It also named SAP and former county auditor Ernest Culver in another $90 million lawsuit. In that suit, Marin County claimed (pdf) that the project vendors had improperly influenced Culver to act favorably towards them by ""approving Deloitte’s deficient work on the project, approving payments, and causing Marin County to enter into new contracts with Deloitte and SAP Public Services, Inc.""

Well, after spending $5 million on its lawsuit in which the judge threw out many of the Marin County’s claims, the county and Deloitte reached a settlement last month in which the county will receive $3.9 million from Deloitte, and nothing from SAP and or Culver.

According to the Marin Independent Journal, which has been following the lawsuits since the beginning, the terms of the settlement are “strictly confidential"" and can't be discussed in any way, shape or form. The only thing the county would say in relation to the settlement was that it ""reduced the total fees paid to Deloitte Consulting and spares the taxpayers the continued expense of litigation. It does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing by either party.”

When the Journal asked the Marin County Counsel about whether the “taxpayers got a raw deal [by] spending $5 million to get a $3.9 million settlement,” the Counsel would only say, “I can't say anything about what you just said.”

How very convenient. The confidentiality agreement allows Marin County managers to keep quiet on how they also colossally mismanaged the project.

As far as I can tell, no one has been fired or demoted over in this IT project debacle either. In fact, according to another Journal story, many of the same folks are working on the plans for the next attempt. But not to worry, County Administrator Mathew Hymel told the Journal, “When we fall short, our goal is to learn from it and do better next time.”

Of course, what those lessons might be can't be discussed—they're confidential, you know.

UK Government CIOs: ERP Systems Don’t Deliver

If you're starting to think that along with the specific incompetencies of all these IT organizations, there might be a fundamental problem with enterprise resource projects in general, you'll be happy to find some confirmation of that coming out of the U.K. An article in Information Week in late January that reported that a survey of 100 U. K. public CIOs and other senior IT and financial managers indicated that, “63 percent of [the] respondents said their ERP system hasn't met their expectations in at least one area. It also suggests that more than 33 percent of respondents have spent more than they had expected on their ERP implementation, 20 percent are disappointed by how their platform met their needs out of the box, and only 20 percent would be prepared to go through a similar ERP project a second time.”

The survey, Information Week stated, was carried out by an independent market researcher but paid for by a local U.K. ERP supplier Advanced Business Solutions.

Those 20 percent who indicated that they would be prepared to go through a similar ERP project a second time are either very good IT project managers, or masochists. Our advice in either event: Try to stay upwind of the stench and smoke from the failed projects started by those project arsonists playing with matches all around you.

2013-02-01T07:00:00Z,California Cancels $208 Million DMV Modernization IT Project, $134 Million spent after 6 years but lack of real progress  ,,,,,,,1.34E8,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Transportation,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/dj-vu-all-over-again-californias-dmv-it-project-cancelled,,Déjà Vu All Over Again: California’s DMV IT Project Cancelled,"The Golden State's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) must think it has checked into an IT version of Hotel California, where once a DMV modernization project is started, it can never ever finish it.

Last week, on behalf of DMV's management, California’s CIO informed state legislators that it had decided to cancel at the end of January the remainder of its US $208 million, 6-year IT modernization project with Hewlett-Packard, which was supposed to be completed in May of this year. As reported in the LA Times, after spending some $134 million ($50 million on HP) and having “significant concerns with the lack of progress,” the DMV decided to call it quits and do a rethink of the program’s direction. HP had apparently saw the handwriting on the wall. Its contract ended last November, and HP refused to hire key staff until the contract was renegotiated.

The DMV IT modernization program was started in 2006 in the wake of a previous DMV project failure (called Info/California) that blew through $44 million between its start in 1987 and cancellation in 1994. That “hopeless failure,” as it was then described, was supposed to be a 5-year, $28 million effort; when it was terminated seven years in, the project’s cost to complete had skyrocketed to an estimated $201 million with an uncertain finish date. A 1994 LA Times story reported that an assessment found the DMV had limited experience in computer technology, grossly underestimated the project’s scope and size, and lacked consistent and sustained management. The project's failure also sparked a full legislative probe.

The current DMV debacle, along with this month’s termination of the MyCalPay’s project, has spurred calls for yet another probe. Legislators could save a lot of time and money by just cutting and pasting from the the earlier project's investigation. I'm sure they'll find a lot of the same inexperience, underestimating, and inconsistent management.

Not all was lost in the current effort: at least a new system for issuing California drivers’ licenses was rolled out. However, the critical vehicle registration portion of the DMV system, with its decades-old “dangerously antiquated technology” (pdf), will have to stay in use while a new go-forward plan is developed.

In looking over the latest project status reports, I couldn’t help but notice how California Technology Agency can be so exact with the project’s total estimated cost ($208 103 287.00), yet be so inexact about the DMV’s IT modernization status. According to the CTA’s dashboard, the project’s status was “yellow” (meaning that the project is slipping) right up until the day it was cancelled. As far as I can tell it never reached “red,” meaning “a project that is in need of immediate intervention.” Coincidentally, the US Air Force’s $1 billion Expeditionary Combat Support System (ECSS) project humiliation was also rated by the US Department of Defense’s CIO as “yellow” right up to the day it was terminated. Maybe we should alert the fashion press that yellow is the new red.

This is the second DMV-related fiasco in the past six months for HP courtesy of EDS, which it bought in 2008. As I mentioned in December, HP and the state of Vermont agreed to a “no-fault” divorce over a botched six-year, $18.5 million DMV IT system modernization effort. HP agreed to refund Vermont the $8.37 million it was paid, and Vermont returned to HP all the physical and virtual rights to the software and documents created by HP. Vermont citizens will have to put up with their 36-year old DMV IT system for a while longer as well as the state tries to figure out what to do next.

EDS won the Vermont DMV contract in 2006, and that no doubt helped it in its bid to win the California DMV contract in 2007. However, I don’t think either state would now agree much with HP’s claim that as far as motor vehicle administration solutions, it has “The right technology and the right skills.”

I don't know the record length of time and number of attempts for trying to replace an IT legacy system, but for the moment, California's DMV's 26 years and two attempts and still counting has to be close. Anyone have one better?

We start off with U.S. taxpayers who will be waiting for their tax refund checks a bit longer than expected because of problems with some companies’ tax software products.

H&R Block and Other Tax Software Product Problems Delay Tax Refunds for Over 600 000

According to several news reports, H&R Block, one of the world's largest tax services providers, which files about 1 in 7 U.S. tax returns, announced on its blog that there was “a disconnect in the transmission of form 8863 from our delivery system to the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] E-file system”. That disconnect caused a delay in its customers getting their tax refunds. Federal Form 8863 (American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning Credits) is used to claim two higher education credits. Over 600 000 H&R Block customers who had their forms filed between 14 February 22 February are said to be affected, a story at the Washington Post reports.

Part of the problem lay with the IRS – or more specifically actions by the U.S. Congress – which delayed this year’s filing period and required changes to Form 8863. Both actions apparently caught H&R Block and “a limited number of software company” product developers off-guard, the IRS said. The tax software problems have reportedly been fixed, but refunds might be delayed by up to 8 weeks in some cases.

In another problem, about 10 days ago, Minnesota tax officials said that anyone using Intuit’s TurboTax software to file their state tax returns could be filing erroneous tax returns. At first, Intuit downplayed the errors claiming that they affected only non-obligatory tax issues such as donating $5 to a political party, but state officials countered last Monday by saying that there were about a dozen problems with the TurboTax software, most affecting tax computations, Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) reported.

Within a few days of the state's announcement, Intuit claimed that its tax software was fixed and said that only 10 000 filers were affected. However, state tax officials told MPR that as of Friday, “it still isn't sure flaws in Intuit's TurboTax tax preparation software have been fixed.” The state is still telling residents not to use TurboTax until it has fully tested out the software. It also said that some14 000 tax returns using the software have been found to contain software-related errors.

Intuit says that it “will issue refunds to affected Minnesota state TurboTax customers for the full amount of their tax preparation fees.” Somehow, I don't think that will appease many filers who will now need to file amended returns.

Billing Problem Affect 145 000 Customers of EnergyAustralia

The Australian reported last week that problems with the introduction of EnergyAustralia's new IBM developed billing system has meant that some 145 000 customers have not been billed for their electricity or gas usage on time, including 21 000 that have not been billed at all. The Australian says errors in the new billing system are apparently higher than anyone expected.

The Australian quotes a source as saying, “The backlog is caused by IBM middleware (software) unable to handle sales files sent by third parties such as distributors. Due to inadequate validity checking, errors are created and the IBM team in India is woefully undermanned to handle the workload. These errors have to be manually fixed, which has resulted in a growth in the backlog.”

EnergyAustralia acknowledges the system is undergoing “teething problems” and that IBM has doubled its support staff to handle the problems. The energy company also insists, however, that it’s only a “small number of customers who haven’t had the best experience.”

EnergyAustralia has about 1.25 million residential and business customers.

Montreal Métro System Shuts Down

Last Wednesday, as feared, all four lines of Montreal’s Métro System shut down completely over the lunch hour because of known software problem in a critical main computer system server. According to a story in the Montreal Gazette, a series of Métro System shut-downs early last summer revealed that a there was an “unstable server” which is “part of the main computer system used to operate the métro.” The server is used to send and receive information from “most of the systems in the métro,” Montreal’s transit agency officials stated.

A software patch was installed last July, but métro engineers determined in October that a “more complex patch” was required. The patch has been under-development since then and is scheduled to be installed late this month or early in April.

However, on Wednesday morning, engineers noticed that the server’s software was becoming unstable again and was passing “bad data” to the main computer system. The engineers planned a controlled shutdown of the métro a little after noon for about 10 minutes in order to go to the back-up system. Unfortunately, the métro’s main computer system shut itself down before the engineers did as the “server gave bad data to the system and saturated the memory” of the computer. This uncontrolled shutdown complicated things, transit agency officials said.

It took over an hour to restore finally service.

Montreal’s transit agency officials apologized once again to métro riders, who have suffered outages in January and February as well. Agency officials promise the system will be better once the new software patch is put into place.

Yet Another Tesco Pricing Glitch

Given their regularity, it almost seems that U.K. retailer Tesco is deliberately creating pricing glitches to attract customers to its stores. As reported by the Telegraph, the latest pricing glitch “allowed shoppers to buy one product and get three free on 500g packs of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (ICBNB) and multipacks of Danone Onykos yogurts.” According to the Telegraph, the pricing error worked both in the store and on-line. One shopper claimed to have paid just £9 for yogurt worth £133.

A Tesco spokesperson said that it was supposed to “be a simple buy one get one free offer” but an “IT error” was responsible for the unintended “unbeatable value.”

Last month, another Tesco pricing error showed up on in-store ads in relation to Thorton’s Premium Collection Chocolates. Here, however, the error turned a 50 percent off a £7 box deal instead into a final price of £7.35 a box.

You win some, you lose some.

Woman Arrested After Spending Money Due to Pay Error

There was a story from radio station WTAQ Wisconsin about a woman in Wisconsin being arrested for spending some $10 000 paid to her by mistake by her former employer.

According to WTAQ, the woman worked for the Stein Garden Center in the City of Oconomowoc and normally earned $8.25 an hour for her labors. However, a computer error changed it to $88.25 an hour. Apparently, on receiving a windfall of $10 000, she decided to quit her job rather than tell her employer of the error.

About a month after she quit, her employer found the error and wanted the money back. The woman allegedly told the company she didn’t know anything about an error in her pay. When a police detective was called in to investigate, she then told him that she “thought the money had come from her aunt and she had already spent it on a new roof for her home.”

She later acknowledged receiving the money in error, but that “she had no intention of repaying it” since “it was the company’s mistake – not hers.”

The woman was charged, I assume with felony theft, and faces six years in prison if convicted, WTAQ reported.

Connectivity Problems Shut Down Newly Opened NHS Trust Surgery

In a bit of an oddball story, the UK press last week reported on a brand new £300 000 National Helath Service (NHS) Trust doctors' surgery in Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire that was shut down four hours after it opened 14 January because of “serious computer connectivity problems.” The problem remains unsolved as of today. According to the BBC, an NHS Gloucestershire spokesperson said, “Both the practice and NHS Gloucestershire have been making every effort to resolve the situation as quickly as possible, and the PCT's IT team has been working with to establish the cause of the problems. We are now very close to resolving the connectivity issues and the [Primary Care Trust] will be meeting with the surgery next week to finalise the options.”

What wasn’t explained in any of the press stories is how such a “connectivity problem” was somehow overlooked before the surgery was opened.

Glitches for Sale

Art based on digital glitches has been around for a while. Now, you can buy a storage unit that looks like it is suffering from a really big glitch. Created by designer Ferruccio Laviani and sold by Italian furniture supplier Fratelli Boff, the “good vibrations” storage unit is said to reflect “a balance between the past and the future, blending the harmony and magniloquence of the classical with the charm and allure of the contemporary” as well as to exemplify “the harmonious juxtaposition of the languages and cultures it is based upon.”

“Echoes of faraway places and Oriental elements are glimpsed in the ‘disorienting’ design of this storage unit, which seems to have been ‘deformed’ by a strong jolt or by swaying movements. Although it appears to depart from the aesthetics of the past, in fact it draws upon ancient knowledge in the use of carving and fine wood workmanship. The appeal of this extraordinary piece of furniture lies in its ability to overturn and question classical stylistic principles such as purity, cleanness and symmetry, while evoking a comforting feeling of deja-vù and a sort of primitiveness, matched by unquestionable craftsmanship.”

Okay, then… to each their own (although I must admit that I harbored some thoughts about this just being an elaborate publicity stunt).

If glitch furniture doesn’t appeal, you can always buy some limited edition US $350 Glitch Textile blankets. The blankets’ patterns, the company says, “are generated using images taken with short circuited cameras and other unorthodox digital techniques.”

These I find much more appealing.

However, state tax officials told MPR that as of Friday, “it still isn't sure flaws in Intuit's TurboTax tax preparation software have been fixed.” The state is still telling residents not to use TurboTax until it has fully tested out the software. It also said that some14 000 tax returns using the software have been found to contain software-related errors.

Intuit says that it “will issue refunds to affected Minnesota state TurboTax customers for the full amount of their tax preparation fees.” Somehow, I don't think that will appease many filers who will now need to file amended returns.

Billing Problem Affect 145 000 Customers of EnergyAustralia

The Australian reported last week that problems with the introduction of EnergyAustralia's new IBM developed billing system has meant that some 145 000 customers have not been billed for their electricity or gas usage on time, including 21 000 that have not been billed at all. The Australian says errors in the new billing system are apparently higher than anyone expected.

The Australian quotes a source as saying, “The backlog is caused by IBM middleware (software) unable to handle sales files sent by third parties such as distributors. Due to inadequate validity checking, errors are created and the IBM team in India is woefully undermanned to handle the workload. These errors have to be manually fixed, which has resulted in a growth in the backlog.”

EnergyAustralia acknowledges the system is undergoing “teething problems” and that IBM has doubled its support staff to handle the problems. The energy company also insists, however, that it’s only a “small number of customers who haven’t had the best experience.”

EnergyAustralia has about 1.25 million residential and business customers.

Montreal Métro System Shuts Down

Last Wednesday, as feared, all four lines of Montreal’s Métro System shut down completely over the lunch hour because of known software problem in a critical main computer system server. According to a story in the Montreal Gazette, a series of Métro System shut-downs early last summer revealed that a there was an “unstable server” which is “part of the main computer system used to operate the métro.” The server is used to send and receive information from “most of the systems in the métro,” Montreal’s transit agency officials stated.

A software patch was installed last July, but métro engineers determined in October that a “more complex patch” was required. The patch has been under-development since then and is scheduled to be installed late this month or early in April.

However, on Wednesday morning, engineers noticed that the server’s software was becoming unstable again and was passing “bad data” to the main computer system. The engineers planned a controlled shutdown of the métro a little after noon for about 10 minutes in order to go to the back-up system. Unfortunately, the métro’s main computer system shut itself down before the engineers did as the “server gave bad data to the system and saturated the memory” of the computer. This uncontrolled shutdown complicated things, transit agency officials said.

It took over an hour to restore finally service.

Montreal’s transit agency officials apologized once again to métro riders, who have suffered outages in January and February as well. Agency officials promise the system will be better once the new software patch is put into place.

Yet Another Tesco Pricing Glitch

Given their regularity, it almost seems that U.K. retailer Tesco is deliberately creating pricing glitches to attract customers to its stores. As reported by the Telegraph, the latest pricing glitch “allowed shoppers to buy one product and get three free on 500g packs of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter (ICBNB) and multipacks of Danone Onykos yogurts.” According to the Telegraph, the pricing error worked both in the store and on-line. One shopper claimed to have paid just £9 for yogurt worth £133.

A Tesco spokesperson said that it was supposed to “be a simple buy one get one free offer” but an “IT error” was responsible for the unintended “unbeatable value.”

Last month, another Tesco pricing error showed up on in-store ads in relation to Thorton’s Premium Collection Chocolates. Here, however, the error turned a 50 percent off a £7 box deal instead into a final price of £7.35 a box.

You win some, you lose some.

Woman Arrested After Spending Money Due to Pay Error

There was a story from radio station WTAQ Wisconsin about a woman in Wisconsin being arrested for spending some $10 000 paid to her by mistake by her former employer.

According to WTAQ, the woman worked for the Stein Garden Center in the City of Oconomowoc and normally earned $8.25 an hour for her labors. However, a computer error changed it to $88.25 an hour. Apparently, on receiving a windfall of $10 000, she decided to quit her job rather than tell her employer of the error.

About a month after she quit, her employer found the error and wanted the money back. The woman allegedly told the company she didn’t know anything about an error in her pay. When a police detective was called in to investigate, she then told him that she “thought the money had come from her aunt and she had already spent it on a new roof for her home.”

She later acknowledged receiving the money in error, but that “she had no intention of repaying it” since “it was the company’s mistake – not hers.”

The woman was charged, I assume with felony theft, and faces six years in prison if convicted, WTAQ reported.

Connectivity Problems Shut Down Newly Opened NHS Trust Surgery

In a bit of an oddball story, the UK press last week reported on a brand new £300 000 National Helath Service (NHS) Trust doctors' surgery in Westbury-on-Severn, Gloucestershire that was shut down four hours after it opened 14 January because of “serious computer connectivity problems.” The problem remains unsolved as of today. According to the BBC, an NHS Gloucestershire spokesperson said, “Both the practice and NHS Gloucestershire have been making every effort to resolve the situation as quickly as possible, and the PCT's IT team has been working with to establish the cause of the problems. We are now very close to resolving the connectivity issues and the [Primary Care Trust] will be meeting with the surgery next week to finalise the options.”

What wasn’t explained in any of the press stories is how such a “connectivity problem” was somehow overlooked before the surgery was opened.

Glitches for Sale

Art based on digital glitches has been around for a while. Now, you can buy a storage unit that looks like it is suffering from a really big glitch. Created by designer Ferruccio Laviani and sold by Italian furniture supplier Fratelli Boff, the “good vibrations” storage unit is said to reflect “a balance between the past and the future, blending the harmony and magniloquence of the classical with the charm and allure of the contemporary” as well as to exemplify “the harmonious juxtaposition of the languages and cultures it is based upon.”

“Echoes of faraway places and Oriental elements are glimpsed in the ‘disorienting’ design of this storage unit, which seems to have been ‘deformed’ by a strong jolt or by swaying movements. Although it appears to depart from the aesthetics of the past, in fact it draws upon ancient knowledge in the use of carving and fine wood workmanship. The appeal of this extraordinary piece of furniture lies in its ability to overturn and question classical stylistic principles such as purity, cleanness and symmetry, while evoking a comforting feeling of deja-vù and a sort of primitiveness, matched by unquestionable craftsmanship.”

Okay, then… to each their own (although I must admit that I harbored some thoughts about this just being an elaborate publicity stunt).

If glitch furniture doesn’t appeal, you can always buy some limited edition US $350 Glitch Textile blankets. The blankets’ patterns, the company says, “are generated using images taken with short circuited cameras and other unorthodox digital techniques.”

These I find much more appealing.

2013-04-01T07:00:00Z,American Airlines Reservation System Out for Over Four Hours Due to Software Issue," Connectivity issues cited, 970 flights canceled and 1068 delayed ",,,4,hours,4,,,,,Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/aviation/american-airlines-still-recovering-from-software-issue-that-grounded-flights-yesterday,,American Airlines Still Recovering from “Software Issue” That Grounded Flights Yesterday,"Yesterday, American Airlines and its regional carrier American Eagle were forced to cancel some 970 flights and delay another 1068 after the airlines experienced “intermittent outages” in communicating with its reservation system. The outages effectively shut down the airlines’ operations, stranding passengers and flight crews alike.

The airline, headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, publicly acknowledged the problem about 11am CDT, and the problem was not fully resolved for another four and a half hours. The reservation system situation caused the airline to request the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to place a ground stop on its aircraft for several hours.

Late yesterday afternoon, American CEO Tom Horton issued an 84-second video statement in which he said, “We experienced a system-wide network outage, causing flight disruptions and inconveniencing many of you. And for that, we are very sorry.”

Horton went on to say, “As you’d imagine, we do have redundancies in our systems, but unfortunately in this case, we had a software issue that impacted both our primary and back-up systems.”

The airline acknowledged that the ""software issue"" did not reside with the Sabre Holdings reservation system it (and many other airlines) uses, but with its own IT operations.

American has said that it will accommodate yesterday’s affected travelers. However, the airline also warns that although it has tried to get its aircraft and flight crews where they needed to be this morning, some residual knock-on effects may linger into today.

It was recently announced that when US Airways and American merge later this year to form the world’s largest airline, American Airlines’ legacy systems will be the ones used.

Given yesterday's events and United Airline’s recent experience, the reservation system cut-over period would probably be a good time to stay home or try another airline.

2013-04-01T07:00:00Z,UK Surrey Police Siren Criminal Investigation System Canceled,£15 Million investment found not fit for purpose,,,,,,,1.5E7,£,GBP,UK,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-27911416,,Siren police IT project's £15m failure a 'debacle',"The Siren system was intended to help officers store intelligence on criminals

Surrey's police and crime commissioner has called for one of Britain's most senior police officers to be held to account for the failure of a multi-million pound computer project.

A report into the £15m system to log crime information found oversight of the project was ""not fit for purpose"".

Surrey PCC Kevin Hurley said Mark Rowley - chief constable at the time - should take responsibility.

But Assistant Commissioner Rowley, who is now at the Met, defended his role.

'No misconduct issues'

The Surrey Integrated Reporting Enterprise Network (Siren) was commissioned by Surrey Police in 2009 but was abandoned last year.

The report, by auditors Grant Thornton, said it was was an ""ambitious project that was beyond the in-house capabilities and experience"" of the police force and police authority.

Mr Hurley said: ""Mr Rowley is no longer employed in Surrey, but if he were I would as PCC be considering how best to hold him to account.

""He is now employed by the Metropolitan Police Service. I will be writing to the Mayor for London Boris Johnson and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, to take action as they see appropriate.""

Siren was specifically designed to log crimes and store intelligence on criminals and suspects.

But Mr Hurley scrapped the project after the force concluded that it did not represent the ""best long-term option for the force and the public"".

Mark Rowley moved to Scotland Yard in 2011

Mr Rowley said he noted there were ""no criticisms of individuals or their conduct"" in the report but said he agreed with its recommendations.

""I'm sure that all those involved in leading this project as officers or from the Surrey Police Authority share with me regret and disappointment that Siren did not realise the benefits for the public we sought,"" he added.

The force spent £14.8m on the project from its inception to 31 March 2013. The money was spent on staff costs, training, software, technology and consultancy.

It was replaced with a less costly crime information system which is used by 13 other forces.

Mr Rowley's roles at the Met include overseeing the development of digital technology.

He is due to take up a new post later this month as head of specialist operations, which includes responsibility for counter-terrorism policing.

Echoing his statement, the Met said: ""The MPS note that the report does not single out any individual for criticism and does not appear to identify any misconduct issues.

""If misconduct allegations are made in relation to any MPS officer, they will be considered in the normal manner.""","UK,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Law Enforcement,,£,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"
2013-05-01T07:00:00Z,Server Issues Hit Online Testing of School Children in Several States," Testing disrupted in Minnesota, Oklahoma, Indiana, Kentucky affects tens of thousands of students ",,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Education,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/it-hiccups-of-the-week-online-testing-problems-spread,true,IT Hiccups of the Week: Online Testing Problems Spread,"Last week saw the ongoing effects of several IT-related problems initially spotted over the past month. We start with problems several U.S. states have been having with the online testing systems upon which they increasingly rely for carrying out all of their standardized testing.

More States Experience Online Testing Issues

In mid-April, I wrote about how 15 000 Minnesota students who were trying to take their Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment online math test either couldn’t sign in or had their tests ended prematurely. The snag was because of a server issue at the American Institutes for Research (AIR), which the state had hired to run the testing. Those kids weren’t alone; more testing problems cropped up about a week later, frustrating the plans of several other Minnesota school districts, Minnesota Public Radio reported. However, a story at the Minneapolis StarTribune says that AIR is denying that the latter testing problems had anything to do with its system. Nevertheless, the ongoing online testing issues forced the state’s education officials to announce last week that they are pushing back the deadlines by which the exams have to be administered. The math and reading tests were to have been completed by May 10 and science tests by May 17. No new completion dates have yet to be set.

The Minnesota students having trouble taking their online tests apparently have lots of company. According to an Associated Press story, students in Oklahoma, Kentucky and Indiana also have had difficulties with their online tests. Other news reports highlighted testing issues in Ohio and Alabama. Again, server-related issues seemed to be a root cause. The problems in these states were similar to those experienced in Minnesota: students couldn’t log on, suffered slow response times, or were kicked off in the middle of their tests. Testing in Oklahoma and Indiana is run by CTB/McGraw-Hill; in Kentucky, ACT oversees the student assessments.

The problems in Indiana not only have students on edge, but teachers too, as their merit pay is tied to student test scores. McGraw-Hill, which has a four-year, $95 million contract to operate the state’s online testing system, could be fined “$50 000 for each day last week the test was down,” WTRV Channel 6 in Indianapolis reported. McGraw-Hill apologized for the problems students had in both Oklahoma and Indiana, saying “We sincerely regret the problems we have caused,” and offering assurances that everything is fine now. The apology rang pretty hollow to many teachers and parents of students affected by the outages, however.

In Kentucky, the problems have caused state officials to suspend online testing for students who haven’t completed their tests and move back to the tried-and-true, paper-and-pencil approach. According to various news reports, state officials acted after ACT gave conflicting reports on the status of its testing system.

ACT was said to have “apologized for any inconvenience"" caused.

CBOE Knew of Software Bug before Meltdown

On 25 April, a “software glitch” at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the largest U.S. options exchange, forced a three-hour delay in trading, the Wall Street Journal reported at the time. The problem came as CBOE executives were in Las Vegas hosting an industry conference. In the immediate aftermath of the outage, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was said by the WSJ to be concerned about the length of the outage, and traders interviewed called it a “big deal” and “unnerving.” After the smoke cleared, the actual damage was characterized as minimal.

A Bloomberg News article reported that the CBOE blamed the outage on an undisclosed “software bug” that was a result of “preliminary work in preparation for reconfiguring its computer systems.” The options exchange was “preparing to change its systems to get ready for extended trading hours on the CBOE Futures Exchange and eventually CBOE options,” Bloomberg stated.

Bill Brodsky, the exchange’s CEO, told Bloomberg that, “Early Thursday morning our team identified and addressed a potential software issue and subsequently believed we were on track for a normal open.” Somewhat controversially, Brodsky then added, “Unfortunately, the nature of a software bug is sometimes only identifiable once the system is operationally ready; such was the case last Thursday at CBOE. As we approached the open, it became apparent that the software issue was not fully resolved, and the decision was made to delay the opening.” Many took this as an admission of poor testing and or contingency management discipline at the CBOE.

According to a Chicago Tribune story, Brodsky explained that the exchange didn’t go to a back-up system because it was worried about “thoroughly preserving the integrity of the orders it already had received that morning.” In addition, the Tribune story quoted a trader who said he was told by an unidentified CBOE staffer that the software bug caused a “corrupt data file load which is necessary to tell all the systems which option contracts are available for trading” that needed to be fixed before trading could start. The CBOE would not confirm that particular explanation of what happened to the Tribune, however.

The outage has caused the CBOE to delay its plans to extend after hours trading until it is “satisfied that there would be no repeat of the technical issues” involved, the WSJ reported on Friday.

New Zealand’s Inland Revenue Department Computer Crashes

In another outage that was predictable if not specifically predicted, the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department’s main computer crashed last Thursday, 2 May. It was down for the morning, but returned to normal that afternoon, the New Zealand Herald reported. The crash’s timing was interesting because just the day before, the Otago Daily Times reported, Inland Revenue Department Minister Peter Dunne “announced the Government's biggest ever overhaul of a Government IT system—a $1.5b upgrade of the department's ‘First mainframe’ computer system.” The department's legacy computer system that needs replacing dates back to 1991.

One of the reasons given for the upgrade, Dunne said, is that half of the 1100 data entry staff is currently devoted full time to “correcting data entries in the system.” Another reason is that a 2011 internal study (pdf) showed the Revenue Department staff believed the organization was facing ""a 40 percent chance of a systems failure that would severely impact its ability to collect and distribute money.” While Thursday's crash impact wasn't major, the event is probably being seen as a near miss ""warning"" signal of something that could be much worse.

The Revenue Department expects the computer systems upgrade to take 10 years, although longer is also a distinct possibility it said. More systems crashes like last Thursday's are no doubt an increasing possibility as well.

H&R Block Offers $25 Cash Cards In Attempt to Appease Customers

As we noted in March, H&R Block, one of the world's largest tax services providers, had a problem electronically transmitting Form 8863 to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. As a result, hundreds of thousands of taxpayers had their tax refunds delayed. Due to the mishap, H&R Block was hit with a number of lawsuits claiming, among other things, that affected customers were inadequately compensated for the mistake.

Last week, H&R Block announced that it is sending out a personal apology letter and a US $25 MasterCard cash card to all the customers it had inconvenienced.

There was no word about any of the lawsuits being dropped as a result of the compensation.

2013-05-01T07:00:00Z,BBC Blows £98.4 Million on Failed Digital Media Initiative, BBC admits to poor project management ,,,,,,,9.84E7,£,GBP,UK,Project Failure,Government,National,Commerce and Communications,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/bbc-blows-984m-on-digital-media-initiative-project,,BBC Blows £98 Million on Digital Media Initiative,"The announcement last week that the BBC pulled the plug on its overly ambitious and admittedly poorly managed Digital Media Initiative (DMI), probably drew a smile from the folks who originally worked for Siemens Information Solutions and Services (SIS) group, now owned by ATOS. The BBC admitted that the project, which was said by BBC Trust's Anthony Fry to have created “little or no assets,” cost license fee holders £98.4 million (about US $150 million at current exchange rates).

To understand the former Siemen’s workers presumptive glee, you need to go back a few years.

In February 2008, the BBC directly awarded a £79 million, fix-priced contract to Siemens under an existing outsourcing contract to implement, roll out, and operate through March 2015 what the BBC called its Digital Media Initiative. According to a 2011 National Audit Office (NAO) review, “DMI is a technology transformation project designed to allow BBC staff to develop, create, share, and manage [all] video and audio content and programming on their desktop, and intended to improve production efficiency across the BBC,” anywhere the BBC operated. In other words, DMI was meant to radically change the way the BBC operated internally.

The BBC's business case put the total DMI project investment, including its management and other administrative costs, at £81.7 million, and claimed that the project would end up generating a total benefit of £99.6 million. The benefit, the NAO indicated, would come from reduced operating costs, the avoidance of some future production costs, and a “creative dividend” savings that would accrue from being able to reuse material instead of having to produce entirely new content.

Siemens was on the hook to deliver all technology required for roll-out to BBC business units by May 2009, with an initial delivery by November 2008. However, by February 2008, one month into the contract, the effort was already starting to slip as it became clear that the November 2008 initial delivery was more likely going to end up being February 2009.

But by February 2009, Siemens still had nothing to deliver, and by May 2009, it was obvious that the BBC would probably need to contractually cancel the project with Siemens, which seemed to the NAO to be in over its head. The NAO report indicates that over the next several months, both sides jockeyed over how to blame the other for the project's delay.

In September 2009, the DMI contract to Siemens was canceled by mutual agreement with an effective date of 31 July 2009. The settlement, along with some creative cost accounting allowed the BBC to claim that it had effectively recouped £27.5 million from Siemens.

The BBC then took over the project itself, claiming it could handle it; however, now the DMI project was 21 months behind schedule which would change the project's value for money proposition. In November 2009, a new business case for DMI was submitted to the BBC Finance Committee which indicated that the project investment was now going to be some £105.1 million, and the benefit was going to only be £74.1 million because of the delay in rolling out the project, the NAO report stated. The Finance Committee rejected the business case because it didn’t believe that the benefits as identified could be secured.

In June 2010, a new DMI business plan was submitted to the Finance Committee which now indicated the investment required would be £133.6 million (minus the £27.5 million settlement from Siemens), or £106.1 million in total. The benefits were now said by the BBC to be £97.9 million. To achieve the increased benefits created, instead of rolling out DMI to 6 BBC business units as originally, it would need to be rolled out to 13. The new final completion project date was slipped from March 2015 to March 2017, as well.

Even though the Finance Committee was skeptical of the new benefits calculation (believing them still to be optimistic), this time it grudgingly approved the DMI business case.

By September 2010, the Finance Committee was probably having second thoughts, for the DMI project quickly slipped its schedule another five months; the estimated benefits to be achieved dropped to some £95.4 million, too. The NAO estimated that the expected project costs now exceeded benefits by some £38.2 million.

In February 2011, the NAO formally published its review of the DMI project. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, stated that the “early stages of this Programme was disappointing and did not achieve value for money. However, since taking the Programme back in house, delivery of the system has progressed well, and users have responded positively. The real test of value for money of the Programme as a whole will be the take up by users across the BBC and elsewhere, and on this it is too early to conclude.”

When the NAO report was released, BBC Trustee Fry was definitely upbeat about DMI's eventual success. He stated that while “the early phase of the project ran into significant difficulties… the BBC reacted with speed and efficiency and since bringing it in-house, delivery is progressing as planned.” The BBC told the NAO that the roll out of the DMI technology would occur during the summer of 2011, which if true, would indicate that the project was indeed getting back on track.

Yet, apparently, the “delivery of the system” didn’t progress very well at all. In October 2012, the BBC’s Director of Operations Dominic Coles quietly paused the DMI development in order to do a reassessment of whether the project still met BBC business objectives. According to Coles, the DMI technology being rolled out to the BBC business units had “proved far more challenging than expected.” For example, much of the technology scheduled to be delivered in the summer of 2011 wasn’t in fact delivered until early 2012, and when it was, users were very unhappy with it, calling it “clunky” and needing redesign, according to the Guardian. Needless to say, the late roll out created additional project costs and delays to the schedule, not to mention a further erosion of the project's benefits.

Adding a wildcard into the mix was that commercial off-the-shelf technology was appearing that could perform most of what the DMI was intended to do and at significantly lower cost. The Guardian article noted just a few months ago BBC Sports was planning to get its own DMI capability from outside suppliers, but at a cost of only £500 000. BBC’s homegrown technology, which looked state of the art in 2007, was likely going to be hopelessly obsolete by the time it was finally delivered as well as terribly expensive to operate or later improve.

So, after reviewing last fall's assessment, the new BBC Director General Tony Hall quickly decided last week that rather than to continue to throw good money after bad, it was time to cancel the “ambitious project” and accept a “total cost” hit of £98.4 million. Lord Hall grimly concluded that, “The DMI project has wasted a huge amount of license fee payers' money and I saw no reason to allow that to continue which is why I have closed it.”

Lord Hall also said that, “We will be looking into what has happened and will take appropriate action, disciplinary or otherwise.”

Even before looking, Lord Hall immediately suspended (with pay) the BBC’s Chief Technology Officer John Linwood, who oversaw the DMI effort. He made Coles the acting CTO. I expect Linwood to resign in the not too distant future, assuming he isn't let go.

MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee called the cancellation, “a terrible shock and clearly completely shambolic,” a BBC News story said.

Shambolic certainly, but given the project’s dismal history, it can hardly be said to be a shock. More shocking was why the project wasn’t canned by the BBC Finance Committee back in 2010 or in late 2011 when cost and schedule had to be climbing again, and the business case was rapidly unraveling once more. Group optimism (or hope) apparently outweighed hard-nosed business sense.

One of the project governance controls put into place as a way to keep future projects from crash and burning, the BBC told the NAO during its DMI review, was that “BBC’s investment policy states that business cases must return to the Finance Committee for additional approval if the costs or benefits over the whole life of the project change by the lower of £1 million or 10 percent.” However, I can’t find any mention of a new business case being submitted to the BBC Finance Committee for DMI after the last one in 2010. Given the ongoing problems on the project, I would have half-expected a new business case to have had to have been submitted almost weekly.

If a new business case wasn’t indeed submitted as required, shame on the DMI project manager and senior BBC leadership for ignoring the need for one. If a new case was submitted, and the Finance Committee continued to approve it, shame on the Finance Committee.

Hopefully the “lessons learned” report that is to be conducted into the fiasco will shed light on whether proper BBC project governance controls were followed or willfully ignored.

It will now be interesting to see whether Lord Hall decides that it is time to poison the BBC’s ambitious but still inoperable Socrates (Open source, Collection, Reversioning, Archiving, Tailored, Export, System) foreign language to English computer translation system that is six years late and counting. Siemens is probably thrilled it wasn't offered that project.

2013-06-01T07:00:00Z,Tennessee Cancels $37 Million Vision Integration Platform (VIP) Project ," Project was in 7th year, and had cost $20 Million without producing much of value ",,,,,,,2.0E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://archive.wbir.com/rss/article/271940/2/-State-pulls-plug-on-multi-million-dollar-computer-system,,State pulls plug on multi-million dollar computer system,"FILED UNDER



Tennessee officials are halting work on a multi-million dollar computer project after years of missed deadlines and design defects.

Leaders in the Department of Human Services informed employees Thursday that its contract with a software developer will be allowed to expire in June, discontinuing seven years of work on the Vision Integration Platform (VIP).

The software was being put in place to modernize how the department handles its food stamp and Medicaid caseload. The system was also supposed to determine eligibility and connect with other state agency computers.

Department leaders offered little detail on Friday about what went wrong or what will happen next.

""This is a very complex project overall,"" said Tricia Reinhard, DHS finance and administration director. ""We're examining every alternative we have, including what we already have in place with VIP.""

The project was launched in 2005 with a $37 million price tag and a four-year contract awarded to Atlanta-based Albion Inc., according to a news release at the time. The company won a competitive bid against four others.

Officials wanted the system to replace the outdated ACCENT software created in 1992, before major changes to the way the department oversees its programs and funding were set in motion.

But the first targeted completion date came and went in 2009.

A state comptroller audit in 2012 said the software was designed and being tested, but that changes were in the works, ""due to defects in current designs or new functionality requirements."" The completion date was pushed back to April 1 of this year.

Auditors said that midway through 2011, DHS had spent $18.6 million, with an additional $19.5 million budgeted for the rest of the effort.

The department also budgeted $1.2 million to pay other companies for quality assurance, most of which was spent - bringing the total spent on the program so far to just under $20 million.

In late 2012, department spokeswoman Devin Stone said deadlines were put off ""to ensure that the department is building the best possible IT system.""

Reinhard wouldn't detail what caused delays.

""We intended to have a project end date of 2009 and now it is 2013,"" she said.

At one point last year, the project triggered a lawsuit between a contractor and a subcontractor concerning incomplete work. Officials said the suit did not contribute to delays. The companies dismissed the lawsuit in January.

About 50 DHS staffers were dedicated to the VIP at any given time. They will return to other work duties while the department continues using its current software, in place for 20 years now, Reinhard said.

Delays not unique to DHS

The VIP software isn't the only large-scale technology project to challenge the state. Others, typically involving contractors, have hindered operations in agencies including the Department of Children's Services, the Department of Revenue, and the Department of Labor and Workforce Development. The state also had problems creating its ""Project Edison"" payroll system.

Those snags prompted Gov. Bill Haslam to create a Business Solutions Delivery office to centralize IT expertise and contracting.

Difficulties also contributed to a recent administration decision to require the state's 1,600 information technology workers to reapply for their jobs. A consulting firm will be screening out employees with lagging skills.","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

Southwest Airlines Computer Failure Cancels 57 Flights, Grounds Another 250

Last Friday night at about 8 p.m. PDT, Southwest Airlines, the largest U.S. domestic carrier, with 3400 flights daily, experienced a system-wide computer failure that grounded the airline’s entire fleet not already in the air, the AP reported. Full service was restored by 11 p.m. PDT, but not before the airline had to cancel 43 flights (originally reported as 50) and delay about 250 others mostly west of the Mississippi River. Flights in Minneapolis, Chicago, Phoenix, Denver and San Diego were said to be affected. The airline also had to cancel another 17 flights early Saturday morning because crews and equipment were in the wrong place.

The computer failure, a Southwest spokesperson told the AP, “impaired the airline's ability to do such things as conduct check-ins, print boarding passes and monitor the weight of each aircraft.” Planes on the taxiways were recalled to the terminals although planes in flight were unaffected. The airline was able to get its back-up system operational, although the system's performance was said to be “sluggish.” Southwest got its primary system back up and operating normally by early Saturday, but the airline indicated it still wasn’t exactly sure of the source of the problem.

Southwest said it “sincerely apologized” for the “airport technology issue.” Luckily, the failure hit late on a Friday night, instead of first thing Monday morning. Southwest also seemed to do a good job in being able to get its customers who were scheduled to be aboard the canceled flights rebooked: there was little grousing in the press from disgruntled Southwest passengers.

As you may remember, American Airlines had to cancel 970 flights and delay another 1068 when a computer problem hit mid-morning on a Tuesday and lasted for only 90 minutes more than Southwest’s snafu. However, American's problem—whose cause has, to my knowledge, never been disclosed—affected its back-up system as well.

American Airlines, along with United, had another computer-related system problem last Wednesday, but it was localized to Philadelphia International Airport. The AP reported that an airport spokesperson said there was a “connectivity issue” that “started early Wednesday morning in a computer system at a ticketing counter. It caused problems for several hours before the issue was resolved by 9 a.m.” CBS News, on the other hand, reported that United Airlines said the problem, which took out their computer systems and phones, was a power outage that began at about 4:45 a.m.

Regardless of the true cause, the problem caused United to cancel six flights and delay several others. American delayed flights, but reportedly did not cancel any.

No other airline at the airport reported having any problems.

Utah and Colorado Motor Vehicle Systems Have Problems

Last week saw the motor vehicle systems in both Utah and Colorado suffer outages. Last Tuesday, the Salt Lake Tribune reported that a “database error” crashed the state’s drivers license records system. The Tribune stated that the incident was the result of “a code-reading error involving a daily transfer of motor vehicle records from the state Tax Commission to a DPS [Department of Public Safety] database.”

The Utah DPS was able to get its back-up system working, which allowed the state’s law enforcement officers limited access to records, but all processing of license applications and renewals came to a halt. The system was fixed by late Tuesday night, and normal operations resumed by Wednesday morning.

On Saturday, Colorado's lone state motor vehicle office open on weekends was “unable to provide new vehicle registrations, renewals or title work” because of a crash of the Colorado State Motor Vehicle system, the Colorado Springs Gazette reported. The office, located in Colorado Springs, was still “able to address drivers licenses, recording and elections,” the paper said. A news release at the state’s website seemingly blamed the problem on a network issue. A network problem affected motor vehicle offices across the state last month as well. The state said it appreciated everyone’s patience and apologized for the inconvenience.

1900 New York City High School Graduates Receive Post-it Note Diplomas

Some 57 000 New York City high school seniors graduated last week. For an unlucky 1900 or so, instead of receiving high school diplomas as they accepted congratulations from their principals, they each received a Post-it Note with their “name scrawled in Sharpie,” the New York Times reported. The reason for the less than thrilling recognition of achievement was because of an error at McGraw-Hill, the company that was in charge of scanning in the results of state’s Regents exams.

There is a bit of a backstory here that needs explanation. As the Times story described, for this school year, New York City school officials placed into effect a new Regents exam grading approach. In the past, officials felt teachers were grading their own students’ exams too easily, so they decided that the completed exams should be scanned and sent randomly to other teachers in the city to grade.

However, the company responsible for the exam scanning, McGraw-Hill Education in Connecticut, had what it called “intermittent slowdowns” which delayed the return of the exams to teachers be graded. The Times said the scanning system “broke down.”

New York City was forced to hire extra teachers over this past weekend to try to complete all the exam grading before school ends on Wednesday of this week. The New York Daily News says that McGraw-Hill will have to pick up the $42 an hour tab the extra teachers are going to be paid.

New York City Comptroller John Liu, who is running for mayor, wants McGraw-Hill to pay back the US $3 million the city spent on the scanning contract with the company. Liu is said by the Times to be considering an audit of the contract. In a related story, the state of Indiana announced on Friday that it plans to sue McGraw-Hill for its problems with administering standardized tests in that state. The announcement came on the same day company President Ellen Haley was apologizing to the state legislature for them.

An apology to New York City’s graduating seniors didn’t seem to be forthcoming from the city’s Education Department. A spokesperson there tried to minimize the issue by telling the Times that the department had expected some “bumps” and that “the problem affected fewer than 3 percent of the roughly 57,000 seniors”, and anyway, “each year there was a relatively small number of students who received their scores, and their diplomas, after graduation ceremonies.”

In other words, those graduating seniors who didn’t get their diplomas on time should quit griping and just be happy admiring the framed graduation Post-it Notes adorning their living room walls.

We start off this week’s edition with a bank which blamed a house repossession error on bad GPS coordinates.

Bank Repo Crew Repossesses Wrong House

Katie Barnett of McArthur, Ohio, returned to her house after a two week vacation to find that the locks on her doors had been changed. Fearing that a squatter had tried to take over her home while she was away, Barnett broke in only to find that all her possessions were gone, says a story in the Daily Mail.

What Barnett soon found out was that a repo crew sent by First National Bank of Wellston, Ohio, had mistaken her house for the bank-owned home across the street, even though her house number is 514 and the one across the street is numbered 509.

According to an ABC News story, the bank’s president and CEO Anthony Thorne put out a statement (pdf) on the bank's website that blamed the problem on a GPS error. Thorne’s statement says that the GPS locator led the bank's “representatives” to the “wrong home, which was located on the same street as the target property (we have since retraced their route using the same GPS, and it again took us to the same wrong location).”

The representatives, Thorne claims, “noted that the grass was overgrown, the door was unlocked, and the utilities had been turned off. The home was also nearly empty, with two dressers being the only furniture inside the premises, and a neighbor indicated that the home had been vacant for some time.” So they apparently assumed that even though the house number was wrong, they were at the right place.

Thorne stated, “This situation was a mistake on the part of our bank and—as we have done previously—we sincerely apologize to the homeowner for the inconvenience and concern it may have caused. In addition, we communicated to the homeowner our desire to compensate her fairly and equitably for her inconvenience and loss.”

There seems to be a disagreement, however, over the amount of compensation owed. Barnett provided the bank with an itemized list of what she claimed was lost, which she said amounted to US $18 000 of personal property. However, the bank disagrees that the two dressers and other personal property it says its representatives discovered in the house were worth that much. The bank wants Barnett to come up with receipts for what she claims the representatives removed, and then the bank will decide how much to pay based on a fair market valuation. Exactly how Barnett is supposed to come up receipts that would be likely be in the “trash” that the bank’s representatives admittedly threw out wasn’t explained by the bank in it's statement.

Barnett is now planning a lawsuit against the bank.

Technology, Equipment Problems Blamed for 1 in 4 Surgical Errors

The prospect of undergoing a surgical procedure is always likely to cause anxiety. A research study published last week in the UK journal BMJ Quality & Safety will probably only make going under the knife even more anxiety inducing. According to the study of surgical technology and operating-room safety failures, nearly one-quarter (23.5 percent) of all surgical suite errors can be attributed to “failures of equipment/technology.”

The research study, which examined published studies on surgical safety failures, discovered that “an average of 2.4 errors was recorded for each procedure, although this figure rose to 15.5 when an independent observer recorded the errors,” a story at Science Daily noted.

Of the failures categorized as being related to equipment issues, 37 percent were attributed to equipment availability, 44 percent to problems with equipment configurations and setting, and 33 percent to device malfunctions. It is unclear how many device malfunctions are the direct result of software problems, or if equipment issues also involve operator error—which has been a concern recently with robotic surgery.

A story at LiveScience indicated that medical errors affect around 15 percent of patients, with half of these resulting in adverse events. Not surprisingly, LiveScience noted that the BMJ Quality & Safety study found “operations that rely heavily on technology, such as heart surgeries, had higher rates of equipment problems than did general surgeries.”

Using pre-operative checklists, standardizing the use of briefing tools, and improving staff training reduced error rates by half, the study found.

In addition, a blog post in the New York Times last week reported on another interesting research study (pdf) to be published in next month’s issue of the Mayo Clinic Proceedings; the paper found that “more than 40 percent of established practices studied were found to be ineffective or harmful, 38 percent beneficial, and the remaining 22 percent unknown.”

I can hardly wait until the BMJ Quality & Safety and Mayo Clinic Proceedings studies are compared to see how many equipment/technology surgical safety errors happen in conjunction with ineffective or harmful medical procedures.

Gold’s Gym Customers Hit By Billing Error

While not as traumatic as having your house repossessed, some customers of a Gold’s Gym in Palm Springs, Calif., were less than amused when they found out that a “computer glitch” in the electronic billing system the gym uses charged “thousands of dollars” to their credit card accounts early last week, a story at the Desert Sun reported. According to the Sun’s story, numerous members found they were charged anywhere from US $1500 to $7000 for their monthly membership fees. As a result, many of those gym members found their credit cards and for some, their bank accounts, reportedly overdrawn.

The software error, which originated at third-party Ohio-based credit card billing company Vanitiv, was rectified within a day. Vantiv said no money actually was charged; only a “preauthorization” charge (a hold) was put on the credit cards. Of course, the effect for the cardholder when trying to access his or her money is basically the same. Gold’s Gym says it will refund any bank fees incurred by customers due to the error.

Gold’s Gym wasn’t the only gym hit by Vantiv’s error. According to a story at television station WRAL in Raleigh, N.C., some members of Fitness Connections in that city discovered that credit and debit cards with which they paid their monthly fees had been hit with “preauthorization” charges in the thousands of dollars. The WRAL story says the problem was caused by Vantiv’s billing system dropping a decimal point which turned a US $29.90 monthly membership charge into a $2990 one instead.

Fitness Connection said it would also refund any customer bank fees incurred as a result.

2013-08-01T07:00:00Z,Pennsylvania Won't Renew Contract with IBM Over Botched Unemployment System," Original cost was $106.9 Million, current cost is $166 Million, 4 years late and without critical functionality ",,,,,,,1.66E8,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Labor,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/pennsylvania-wont-renew-ibms-contract-for-botched-project,,Pennsylvania Won’t Renew IBM's Contract for Botched Project,"Pennsylvania’s Labor and Industry Secretary Julia Hearthway announced Wednesday that the state has decided not to renew its contract with IBM to modernize the state’s 40-year-old unemployment compensation computer system. According to an AP report, the contract, which was awarded in 2006 and is set to expire in 2013, is currently 42 months late and over $60 million above its original contract amount of $106.9 million.

IBM's Fred Brooks once famously wrote in his 1975 groundbreaking IT project management book The Mythical Man-Month that IT projects become a year late one day at a time. Of course, Brooks meant it as a warning, not as a goal, something that Brooks may want to explain to his old company.

The state decided to end the contract after a US$800 000 assessment of the effort by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) indicated that the critical objective of the modernization effort, namely a demonstrated “capability to reliably, consistently, and accurately process unemployment claims, calculate payments, and enable payment to eligible citizens who are out of work” doesn’t yet exist, and apparently, there is no agreement when, if ever, such a capability will ever exist.

Hearthway stated that, in wake of the SEI’s assessment, “The bottom line is that the problems we've identified cannot be solved and we will not renew our contract with IBM. The level of risk, combined with the critical nature of the system, demands that the (department) has a system that produces timely decisions reliably and accurately.”

An IBM spokesperson said the company was “surprised” by the state’s decision. In addition, the spokesperson said that, “IBM is fully prepared to continue to bring the benefits of a contemporary unemployment benefits system to the state and its citizens, and we stand ready to work with the state to resolve this matter.”

The IBM spokesperson went on to moan that the company had not seen the SEI report or had a chance to respond to it. He also stated, “In complex information technology implementations, there is accountability on both sides for system performance and service delivery.”

In other words, don’t blame us, instead the blame should be placed on the state’s mismanagement of the system contract for the modernization effort ending up resembling IT roadkill.

The SEI assessment does indicate that the state’s management of the effort left lots to be desired, especially in terms of mismanaging obvious project risks, which allowed them to turn into problems at an ever increasing rate over from 2007 through 2011. The report states that the “approach [or lack thereof] to managing the program from contract award to early 2011 led to a situation in which no one … was accountable and responsible for the administration of the program.”

Naturally, IBM repeatedly pleaded with the state to suspend the contract to allow the state to get its management act together in order to rectify this obvious case of poor project management, right?

Ah, no.

It seems that IBM was very content to let the chaos continue while it collected sums much greater than the original contract called for. And to say it was surprised over the state's decision to not renew the contract is a hoot as well. A Department of Labor and Industry spokesperson said in response to IBM's surprise claim that, ""We've been meeting weekly with them and they know full well all the problems. That's ridiculous that they say they're surprised. They must be in denial.”

Denial, or maybe just forgetfulness? Perhaps IBM forgot that the state has held back $17 million in payments for what it called the company's “shoddy work” on the project. Or maybe IBM forgot that not everyone thinks it is perfectly okay to be a wee bit late on the project and fail to deliver on what is promised. Or possibly IBM forgot that other states like Texas and Indiana recently fired it for less than stellar IT contractual performance, too?

IBM’s reputation will likely take another hit as the Queensland Health Payroll System Commission of Inquiry report which was delivered to the government on Wednesday soon becomes public. You may recall (and IBM definitely doesn't want to), IBM was the prime contractor for what is arguably one of most botched IT projects in history but one that the company insists was an “outstanding success.” The 2008 contract price for the Queensland Health payroll system was A$6.19 million (fixed price); when all is said in done, the final cost to make the payroll system “work” as envisioned could top A$1 billion. Early speculation is that IBM’s corporate image will not be enhanced by the commission report.

Pennsylvania is now going to regroup and figure out what to do next. Luckily the current unemployment system works, albeit more slowly and less efficiently than anyone likes. There may also be elements of the “modernized” system that IBM developed that are salvageable.

U.S. taxpayers are the ones who really should be angry over the fiasco. Of the $170 million spent on the modernization effort, $153 million comes out of federal coffers, not Pennsylvania’s.

2013-08-01T07:00:00Z,Queensland Government Bans IBM from Future Contracts over Health Payroll System Fiasco, Queensland accuses IBM of misconduct ,,,,,,,,,,Australia,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/queensland-government-bans-ibm-from-it-contracts,true,Queensland Government Bans IBM from IT Contracts,"That didn’t take long.

A day after the Queensland Health Payroll System Commission of Inquiry delivered its 264-page blistering report (pdf) on the Queensland Health payroll system project cock-up, which I have been following for the past few years, Australia’s Queensland Premier Campbell Newman released a statement today in which he banned IBM from entering into “any new contracts with the State Government until it improves its governance and contracting practices.” This comes right on the heels of last week's news that Pennsylvania had opted out of renewing its contract with IBM to modernize the state's unemployment compensation computer system, and yesterday's news that a Credit Suisse analyst cut IBM's stock rating, saying that, “Organically, we believe IBM is effectively in decline.” It's starting to seem like a very bad month for IBM indeed.

Newman cited as a reason for the ban the commission report’s finding that the fiasco—which saw an effort to replace Queensland Health’s legacy payroll system at an expected cost of A$6.19 million (fixed price) explode into one that will cost around A$1.2 billion to develop and operate properly when all is said and done—“must take place in the front rank of failures in public administration in this country. It may be the worst.”

Maybe the scariest thing for Queensland taxpayers reading the report’s conclusion was that the commission wasn’t sure that this farce was the worst in Australian government’s history. Maybe it was unsure because the commission has so many worthy candidates to choose from.

Newman went on to say, “It appears that IBM took the state of Queensland for a ride.”

Newman’s statement warned that before IBM will be allowed to bid again it “must prove it has dealt with past misconduct and will prevent future misconduct.”

Naturally, IBM took exception to the report’s conclusion, saying it was at best only minimally responsible for the project blunder—a major admission for the company which has long insisted it “successfully delivered” what it was contracted for. An IBM spokesperson is quoted in an article today at the Delimiter as saying, “IBM cooperated fully with the Commission of Inquiry into Queensland Health Payroll, and while we will not discuss specifics of the report we do not accept many of these findings as they are contrary to the weight of evidence presented.”

Additionally, the IBM spokesperson stated, “As the prime contractor on a complex project IBM must accept some responsibility for the issues experienced when the system went live in 2010. However, as acknowledged by the Commission’s report, the successful delivery of the project was rendered near impossible by the State failing to properly articulate its requirements or commit to a fixed scope. IBM operated in a complex governance structure to deliver a technically sound system. When the system went live it was hindered primarily through business process and data migration issues outside of IBM’s contractual, and practical, control.”

“Reports that suggest that IBM is accountable for the $1.2 billion costs to remedy the Queensland Health payroll system are completely incorrect. IBM’s fees of $25.7 million accounted for less than 2 percent of the total amount. The balance of costs is made up of work streams which were never part of IBM’s scope.”

In other words, all that money that Queensland has had to spend on those ""work streams"" to get the payroll system to work correctly since we were kicked out ain’t on us.

IBM’s statement, however, studiously avoided tackling head-on a commission conclusion in the report that: “The only finding possible is that IBM should not have been appointed” to the contract in the first place in part because of “ethical transgressions” on the part of some of its employees, including “the obligation not to use the State’s confidential [bid and proposal] information” that it had somehow couldn't explain came into its possession from a restricted government database along with the apparent privileged insider information from a government consultant to the project who happened to be a former-IBM employee.

The report damningly states that IBM’s “conduct shows such disregard for the responsibilities of a tenderer, and a readiness to take advantage of the State’s lapse in security, as to make it untrustworthy.”

This is not to say that the government was blameless in the shamble, either. The commission report states that:

“a. the scoping of the system (ie its definition) was seriously deficient and remained highly unstable for the duration of the Project. That being so, and although the problem was firmly known to each party, no effective measures were taken to rectify the problem or to reset the Project; b. the State, who would ultimately bear the risk of a dysfunctional payroll system, gave up several important opportunities to restore the Project to a stable footing and to ensure that the system of which it would ultimately take delivery was functional. [An expert] characterised the approach of both parties as being ‘Plan A or die’; c. the decision to Go Live miscarried, both because it ought to have been obvious to those with responsibility for making that decision that the system would not be functional and because the decision to Go Live involved no proper and measured assessment of the true risks involved in doing so; d. the system, when it went live, failed to function in a way in which any payroll system, even one which was interim and to have minimal functionality only, ought to have done.”

The report did “clear” former Premier Anna Bligh, former Health Minister Paul Lucas and former Public Works Minister Robert Schwarten of any wrong doing in the decisions they made during and after the screw-up because the three politicos were merely following the advice given to them by their senior public servants. However, the report did not endorse their decisions as necessarily being correct: it notes that, “Those who read the Report, and have an interest in good government, can judge for themselves” whether the decisions made by the former senior Queensland politicians were “improvident” or not.

The commission report makes for a jolly good read for those students of major government IT project catastrophes. I found nothing in it particularly surprising or what I haven't been writing about for years here at the Risk Factor, and the numerous recommendations for the government for avoiding misadventures in the future can be summed up as, “Don’t take on IT projects that you don’t have the professional competence or capability to ensure you aren’t being taken for a ride.”

Good advice that undoubtedly everyone will agree with but will also be studiously ignored in practice.

2013-08-01T07:00:00Z,Sabre Reservation System Experiences Worldwide Outage for 2 Hours," Dozens of flights around the world canceled, many more delayed ",,,2,hours,2,,,,,Worldwide,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/it-hiccups-of-the-week-sabre-outage-hit-flights-worldwide,,IT Hiccups of the Week: Sabre Outage Hit Flights Worldwide,"It’s been another eventful week in the land of IT snags, snarls and complications. We start with another major airline reservation system hiccup, but this time one with world-wide effects.

Sabre Reservation System Outage Affects 400 Airlines

The Sabre airline reservation system experienced a still unexplained two-hour-plus “system issue” beginning at 8:40 p.m. PDT on Monday evening. The outage affected airlines around the world. (Sabre’s website states that about 380 airlines use its reservation system.) As a result, ticket agents needed to hand write boarding passes, and the affected airlines’ websites couldn’t book or change reservations. Where in the world you happened to be at the time impacted how severely you felt the system outage.

In the U.S., a small number of late-night West Coast domestic and international flights experienced delays. In Europe and the Middle East, the effects were felt a bit more, as it was early to mid morning. The greatest problems were felt in Australia, where it was early afternoon Sidney time. Virgin Australia got the worst of it.

Virgin Australia reportedly had to cancel 35 domestic and international flights and delay many others. For whatever reason, Virgin seems snake-bit when it comes to reservation system IT issues. This complication came on the heels of a router outage that occurred just a few weeks ago. You may remember its nearly two week reservation meltdown back in 2010, as well. Virgin moved from Navitaire’s New Skies platform, which was at the heart of the 2010 meltdown, to the Sabre system earlier this year. The costs incurred in the switch helped send the company into the red.

Although the exact number of passengers affected is unknown, it was undoubtedly thousands worldwide given that Sabre says some 300 million passenger reservations are processed by its system every year. On Tuesday, in the wake of the outage, Sabre sent out the standard, “We apologize and regret the inconvenience caused.”

Denver International Airport officials were also apologizing on Tuesday to passengers as all 1200 airport flight boards were out for most of the day.Maintenance had been performed on the system that runs the flight boards on Monday night. The boards were not restored to operation until late Tuesday evening.

False Emergency Warnings Sent in Japan, Virginia, California

The Japan Meteorological Agency sent an emergency message last Thursday warning most of Japan to expect “violent shaking” after detecting a magnitude-2.3 earthquake in Wakayama prefecture in western Japan at 4:56 pm local time, Bloomberg News reported. According to the story, the Wakayama earthquake prompted JMA’s warning system to predict that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake was possible.

As a result of the warning, Central Japan Railway suspended some bullet train operations, and a number of mobile phone networks became jammed as a multitude of people called friends and family.

However, it soon became clear that the prediction was in error. The JMA blamed the false warning on “electrical noise” on the ocean floor, and offered a televised apology. The JMA admitted Thursday's incorrect warning to be the “biggest misreading” since the early warning system was begun in 2007.

On Wednesday morning, human error was blamed for a tornado alert mistakenly being sent to 500 people in the Charlottesville-Albemarle County area of Virginia, the AP reported. Apparently the notification was sent during a training session on how to use the local emergency alert system.

Also on Wednesday, a real emergency alert of a reported gas leak was sent to more people than intended. The automated wireless emergency alert message, which urged residents and businesses to evacuate immediately and only take essential belongings with them, was sent out across all of Contra Costa County, California, instead of the homes and businesses within a 1000 foot radius of a damaged gas pipe. County officials said that they would be working with the vendor the county uses to send alerts to ensure that the messages are better targeted, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

Xerox to Patch Scanner Feature

I doubt many people would think to look at a document they scanned to check whether in fact what was scanned actually match that as on the original. It might be a good idea to do so in the future, however.

Last week, a story Tuesday at BBC News reported that German computer scientist David Kessel “discovered” that the compression software used by several Xerox scanner models had the nasty habit of changing the characters in the scanned document from those on the original document. The Daily Mail published an article showing some of the changes that could result. The legal implications, a London lawyer told the BBC, were “Interesting.”

Xerox played down the error, however, saying that the vast majority of scanner users would never experience the problem since it only happened when the scanner's default resolution setting was reset to low resolution in order to save smaller-sized computer files. The character changing/substitution issue was long known to be a possibility, and a warning about it was in all its user manuals, Xerox said. However, in light of the uproar the BBC News story generated—which was also fueled by Xerox’s nonchalant response to the issue—Xerox said it would be sending out a patch in the next few weeks to disable the highest compression mode which it claimed would eliminate the problem.

Even so, it might be a good idea to routinely check over your scanned documents just in case, and also maybe read your scanner’s user manual. There may actually be something useful in it.

This time, stock market officials are reaching for the antacid.

Nasdaq Suffers Three-Hour Trading “Glitch”

Well, opinions vary about whether it was or wasn’t a big deal. Last Thursday, the Nasdaq suffered what the AP called a “mysterious trading glitch” that suspended trading on the exchange from 12:15 p.m. to 3:25 p.m. EDT. After trading resumed, the market closed up 39 points.

The trading suspension was the longest in Nasdaq history and was a major embarrassment for the exchange, which is still trying to recover from its Facebook IPO screw-up. The exchange blamed the problem on a “connectivity issue” involving its Securities Information Processor, which Reuters describes as being “the system that receives all traffic on quotes and orders for stocks on the exchange.” When the SIP doesn’t work, stock quotations cannot be disseminated.

Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld has refused to discuss the cause of the problem in public. Greifeld did darkly hint, however, that the problems were someone else’s fault. The Guardian quoted him as saying, “I think where we have to get better is what I call defensive driving. Defensive driving means what do you do when another part of the ecosystem, another player, has some bad event that triggers something in your system?”

He then went on to say, “We spend a lot of time and effort where other things happen outside our control and how we respond to it.”

Greifeld’s statement immediately triggered further speculation that the other “player” was rival exchange NYSE Arca, which was known to have had connectivity issues with Nasdaq. Greifield refused, however, to elaborate further on his statements.

Today’s Wall Street Journal published a lengthy story that has shed more light on what happened—although why it happened is still being investigated. According to the WSJ, between 10:53 a.m. and 10:55 a.m. EDT Thursday, “NYSE Arca officials tried and failed to establish a connection with Nasdaq about 30 times, according to people familiar with the events of that day. Nasdaq, for its part, was having its own problems regarding its connectivity to Arca, the people said.”

The WSJ goes on to say that: “What remained unclear Sunday was how that connectivity problem—which Nasdaq officials privately have called ‘unprecedented’—could have had so catastrophic an effect on Nasdaq's systems that the exchange decided to stop trading in all Nasdaq-listed shares, causing ripples of shutdowns across the market and spreading confusion.”

The Journal said NYSE Arca went to a backup system, and after several failed attempts, finally re-established connection with Nasdaq at 11:17 a.m. However, once the two exchanges were reconnected, “Nasdaq's computers began to suffer from a capacity overload created by the multiple efforts to connect the two exchanges.”

As a result, other markets also started to report problems in receiving and sending quotes from Nasdaq. Officials at Nasdaq decided they had better pull the plug in order to figure out how to get back to a normal operating state, which they did at 12:15 p.m.

Many traders viewed the episode as a non-event, while other interested observers, like U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White, were more concerned. Given the complexity of the systems involved, no one should be surprised to see more hiccups in the future. In Charles Perrow’s terminology, they are now just “normal accidents.”

The folks at Goldman Sachs and Everbright were probably very happy about the distraction created by Nasdaq’s difficulties. Last Tuesday, Goldman “accidentally sent thousands of orders for options contracts to exchanges operated by NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX and the CBOE, after a systems upgrade that went awry. The faulty orders roiled options markets in the opening 17 minutes of the day’s trading and sparked reviews of the transactions,” the Financial Times reported.

Bloomberg News reported that Goldman had placed four senior technology specialists on administrative leave because of the programming error, but Goldman declined to discuss why. Probably a smarter move than when Knight Capital Group CEO Thomas Joyce blamed “knuckleheads” in IT when a similar problem a year ago this month resulted in loss of US $440 million in about 45 minutes. Goldman's losses were expected to be less than US $100 million.

Knight Capital was sold last December to Getco Holdings Co.

Everbright Securities, the state-controlled Chinese brokerage, is also likely happy at the timing of Nasdaq’s and Goldman’s problems. On 16 August, a trading error traced to the brokerage significantly disrupted the Shanghai market. The error, which cost the brokerage US $31.7 million and the brokerage’s president his job, was blamed originally on a “fat finger” trade. However, a “computer system malfunction” was the real cause, the Financial Times reported. Needless to say, the China Securities Regulatory Commission is investigating Everbright and says “severe punishments” might be in order.

Finally, a real fat finger incident hit the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) yesterday. The Jerusalem Post reported that, “a trader from a TASE member intending to carry out a major transaction for a different company's stock accidentally typed in Israel Corporation, the third-largest company traded on the exchange. The disparity in prices cause the company's stock value did a nose-dive, from an opening value of NIS 1690 down to NIS 2.10,” or a 99.9 percent loss. The trader quickly realized his typo, and requested the transaction be canceled. However, by then, the error had already triggered a halt in the exchange’s trading.

Helsinki’s Automated Metro Trains Rough First Half Day

Last week, Helsinki's Metro tried out its three driverless Seimens-built trains for the first time. However, in a bit of irony, after a few hours, problems developed with the ventilation system in the trains' drivers cabins, and the trains had to be taken out of service. Drivers were aboard the automated trains for safety reasons. The Metro didn’t indicate whether the trains would have been pulled out of service (or the problem even detected) if they had been running in full automatic mode without drivers.

Indian Overseas Bank Back to Normal

The Hindu Times reported on Friday that the Indian Overseas Bank announced that the problem with the bank’s central server had been finally fixed. For three days, hundreds of thousands of bank customers were unable to deposit checks or use the bank’s ATM network. A story at Business Standard said that the problem was related to annual system maintenance of the core banking system, which instead ended up creating what the bank said was a “complex technological malfunction.”

2013-10-01T07:00:00Z,Federal Health Insurance Exchange Website Fails," Exchange system unstable, insecure ",,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/obamacare-exchange-signups-not-so-much,true,Obamacare Exchange Sign-ups Hobbled by IT Systems Not Ready for Prime Time,"I don’t need to tell anyone about the controversy surrounding the Affordable Care Act (more commonly known as Obamacare). It was the central issue in the game of brinksmanship that led to the U.S. government shutdown last week. But mirroring that mind-blowing dysfunction was the less-than-stellar 1 October rollout of the federal website healthcare.gov. The Obamacare-mandated Web portal lets consumers who don’t have employer-sponsored medical insurance meet the legal requirement to sign up for health coverage through the states where they reside. (To be precise, healthcare.gov is for residents of 36 states whose governments opted not to set up independent healthcare exchanges.) Online exchanges for some of the other 14 states and the District of Columbia also debuted with disappointing results.

So, what happened? Well, it’s no secret that governments are terrible at IT project implementation. Examples abound—as regular readers of The Risk Factor are well aware. (Some of our reporting on recent foul-ups is here, here, and here.) There’s been little evidence so far that these projects are any different.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported Wednesday that there were 6.1 million unique visitors to healthcare.gov on the first day and a half after the site opened on Tuesday. By Friday, that number had surpassed the 8 million mark. That’s a good indicator of the level of interest in getting signed up for health coverage. But it’s only part of the picture. What HHS purposely left out (and left to our imagination) is the actual number of enrollments. Officials said they would probably release enrollment numbers next month after tabulating totals from, online, call centers, and paper enrollments. But the picture that’s forming based on anecdotal evidence is not pretty.

Most attempts to reach the federal website resulted in this:

“We have a lot of visitors on our site right now, and we're working to make your experience here better. Please wait here until we send you to the log-in page. Thank you for your patience.”

Or this:

“Important: Your account couldnt (sic) be created at this time. The system is unavailable.""

According to a Los Angeles Times story, community groups aiming to help people sign up have been frustrated in their attempts to do so. Even large insurance companies, which have a vested interest in getting people enrolled in the exchanges, were unsuccessful in the early going. For example, a spokesman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana, that state's largest insurer, told the Los Angeles Times that, as of Wednesday, the company hadn't been able to enroll anyone through the federal website. Others who left in frustration included reporters including one for the Huffington Post, who said: “Though officials from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they'd made strides correcting the federal exchanges' problems, The Huffington Post made dozens of attempts and still couldn't sign into the website late Tuesday afternoon.”

""We have had a few slowdowns, a few glitches, but it's sort of a great problem to have. It's based on the fact that the volume has been so high and the interest is so high,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said on MSNBC Tuesday. ""We're working quickly to fix that.""

U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park explained further, pointing out that the government expected HealthCare.gov to draw only as many as 60 000 simultaneous users. That estimate was apparently based on a projection from the volume experienced nearly a decade ago on a site for Medicare Part D. But at peak, the Obamacare site was being deluged by up to 250 000 people at a time.

""These bugs were functions of volume,'' Park told USA Today. ""Take away the volume and it works.'' Right. Take away widespread interest in signing up for health insurance, and the portal through which people are supposed to sign up for health insurance will work as intended.

The system’s performance invited a swipe from an IT official from the previous administration. “Whoever thought it would draw 60,000 people wasn't reading the administration's press releases,” David Brailer, former national coordinator of health care information technology under George W. Bush, told USA Today. “The Medicare Part D site [launched in 2006] was supposed to have 20,000 simultaneous users and was [built to accommodate] 150,000, and that was back when computing was done on an abacus. It isn't that hard.”

The news wasn’t any better with the state-run exchanges. California residents were stuck in traffic along both routes to enrollment there: computer glitches stymied attempts to sign up online, while hold times at telephone call centers topped 30 minutes. The computer system created to, among other things, log a consumer’s data and determine whether he or she is eligible for government subsidies to cover part of the premiums, responded so poorly that its operators were forced to shut down the online enrollment system twice. According to the L.A. Times story, “Officials were pleased with the strong consumer interest and vowed to fix the problems.”

On the opposite coast, officials in the second most populous state fielding its own exchange reported what could generously be described as an anomaly. State of Health, the healthcare portal serving New York State, which has a population of roughly 18 million, had reportedly received 30 million hits by late Wednesday, prompting some observers to suspect that hackers may plotting a break-in or an out and out takeover. Whether that’s true or not, Donna Frescatore, director of the state’s exchange, confirmed that despite all that activity, only about 12 000 people had managed to enroll by Wednesday evening.

Responding to questions about the extraordinarily high volume, Frescatore told the Wall Street Journal that, “We have no evidence that this is anything but people learning more about [the site].” Furthermore, said Frescatore, state officials are not looking into the possibility that cybercrime was a contributing factor.

Ahhh…the power of positive thinking.

We can all keep our fingers crossed, but the issue of security will likely pop up again. As we recently reported on this blog, privacy safeguards have likely taken a backseat to getting the exchanges open on time. Another IEEE Spectrum post focusing on the exchanges’ security issues is here.

There’s no question that the overwhelming interest caught New York flat footed. Officials took the Web portal offline Tuesday night. Once the smoke cleared, they doubled its capacity and implemented some fixes aimed at keeping it from getting hung up as it did throughout its first day of real-world operation. What happened on day two? The same thing, more or less.

California and New York weren’t alone in their misery. According to a Huffington Post article, at “Maryland Health Connection, Kynect [Kentucky’s exchange], Connect for Health Colorado, Rhode Island's Health Source RI and others, consumers faced obstacles to setting up accounts or comparing plans—or even viewing the websites at various points in the day.” The Chicago Tribune reported that a glitch affecting Illinois’ exchange—missing fields in an online form—left people attempting to enroll in on the first day unable to figure out whether they were eligible for the federal subsidy for premiums. Though that problem was remedied by the middle of the day, sailing still wasn’t smooth, said the Chicago Tribune article. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn’s advice for those who had trouble accessing the site? ""Just keep trying.""

Criticism of the portals’ bumpy first week has come from all quarters. But the rollout still has its apologists. In an e-mail sent to the Huffington Post, Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who was an architect of the 2006 Massachusetts health care regime after which Obamacare was modeled, says,

""Hours or even days is not the relevant timeframe for evaluating exchanges. The question is simply whether there are ways that folks can sign up to get insurance by Jan. 1. That is a question for late November, not early October. If things are really buggy in six weeks, that could be more of an issue.""

The best “Keep hope alive” message had to be the widely reported one delivered by HHS Secretary Sebelius.

“I clearly have an iPad and I also have an iPhone and about 10 days ago I got the prompt that the operating system had changed,” Sebelius said. Noting that the experience wasn’t great, she added that, “everyone just assumes ‘well there’s a problem, [Apple will] fix it.’” Here’s the good part: “We’re building a complicated piece of technology, and hopefully you’ll give us the same slack you give Apple.”

Matthew Yglesias, writing for Slate, deftly picks the Sebelius comment apart:

“Apple, like any private business, is customer-driven. Apple knows that if it doesn’t provide good products and services, the public will exercise its options, and go to Samsung and Android, or Windows, or even Blackberry…Apple, the world’s most-valuable brand, has a reputation for producing quality products that work. The government has exactly the opposite track record. There is no public confidence in government programs, whether they be in veterans’ affairs, the postal service, the stability of Social Security, containing spending, managing contracts, rooting out fraud, the IRS, the NSA, the EPA, immigration, self-investigating, protecting our Embassies and personnel — you name it.”

As the federal and state governments have repeatedly reminded us, the more than 40 million U.S. residents without employer-sponsored health insurance have until 15 December to enroll in order to get coverage on 1 January, and until 31 March to avoid being assessed a penalty. Will the sites’ managers get their respective acts together in time? I won’t call Sebelius’ and Gruber’s optimistic takes on the situation into question. I’ll simply direct readers’ attention once again to the Risk Factor links in the second paragraph of this post. They’re concrete illustrations of the points Yglesias makes.

The brouhaha with the Affordable Care Act website once more overshadowed other IT-related obstructions, complications and malfunctions reported in last week’s news.

During last week’s news cycle, we learned a great many disturbing things. Among them: only a total of 106 185 people were able to sign up for ACA health insurance through October (27 794 of this total via the federal website); IT success is now defined as 4 out of 5 (in the best case) people being able to sign up for health insurance through the federal ACA website; confidence that the federal ACA website will be working by 30 November as promised is dwindling; the main Federal ACA contractor, CGI, has a less than exemplary record on government IT projects; and the unsurprising revelation that everyone involved with the federal ACA website development knew it was in deep trouble long ago, but no one had the guts to come out and forthrightly say so. And, of course, there was President Obama calling a press conference to apologize for the federal ACA website problems, and offer a temporary reprieve for those who saw their health insurance cancelled because it didn’t meet minimum ACA standards. Obama, who insisted that if only someone had told him that the website was so terrible, he wouldn’t have gone forward with its rollout, may be ginning up IT headaches for health insurers with the administrative changes related to the Affordable Care Act that he announced. We also learned that several states, including Oregon and New York, are reporting problems with their health insurance exchanges. Finally, over $4 billion is estimated to have been spent so far implementing the state health insurance exchanges, while the Federal effort accounts for at least $350 million at last count. Multiply this total amount by three or more to get the estimated IT maintenance cost over the next 15 or so years.

Yet, while the ACA ruckus was going on, several other IT-related inconveniences were reported. For example, Pennsylvania home care workers saw their paychecks delayed or lost for months because Pennsylvania's Department of Public Welfare mismanaged an IT program consolidation. There was news that Verizon has agreed to pay $60 million for botching New York City’s Emergency 911 system implementation, and disclosure of plans by major stock exchanges to try to reduce the IT outages that have been striking with increasing regularity over the past few years.

On Monday, the newspaper The Tennessean ran an article about Nashville-based Bridgestone Americas, Inc., which is part of the Japanese firm Bridgestone Tire and Auto-service Corporation, bringing a US$600 million lawsuit against IBM. Bridgestone alleged in its complaint (pdf) that when the new US$75 million plus SAP-based invoicing, accounting, and product delivery system went live in January 2012, it found ""that there were extremely serious defects in the IBM SAP design solution as implemented which Bridgestone had no reason to expect and for which IBM offered no explanation consistent with the purported concerns IBM had raised.”

As a result, the lawsuit states, “Bridgestone has suffered damages in excess of $200,000,000, and continues to suffer damages from injury to its reputation and customer relations.”

The lawsuit, which was filed 29 October, was sealed until recently. While the legal complaint is heavily redacted, in it Bridgestone alleges that IBM engaged in a “pattern of deception, intentional misrepresentation, and concealment” over its capabilities and the actual status of the project risks and problems. For example, Bridgestone states that IBM “assigned individuals, including the chief technical architect for the project, who did not possess the proper knowledge, skill, education, training, experience, technical expertise, and qualifications to perform the services necessary for the successful design and implementation."" The lawsuit also says a lot of the work was outsourced to IBM workers in India and China who possessed less than stellar development skills and practices.

Bridgestone’s lawsuit alleges: (1) Fraud in the inducement and contract performance; (2) misrepresentation in business transactions; (3) constructive fraud; (4) violations of the Tennessee Consumer Protection Act; (5) gross negligence, and (6) breach of contract. The company wants a jury trial.

IBM, which has taken a battering over other failed IT implementations, including the Queensland Health payroll fiasco, the Indiana government outsourcing farce which is still unresolved, the Texas government outsourcing debacle, and the recent botched Pennsylvania government system implementation, has come out swinging. IBM immediately, publicly, and vehemently rejected the claims brought by Bridgestone. IBM gave its side of the story Wednesday to Business Insider, claiming in a statement that:

“Bridgestone filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and fraud against IBM regarding a recent SAP implementation. These claims against IBM are exaggerated, factually wrong and without merit. From the outset of this project, Bridgestone failed to meet critical commitments upon which the performance of IBM’s obligations were predicated. Ultimately, Bridgestone’s repeated failures had a significant impact on the project’s cost and schedule, and its decision to prematurely roll-out the implementation across its entire business negatively impacted its operations.""

Among the claims IBM made were that:

Bridgestone understood that this would be a challenging project. It had tried several times with other vendors and failed to upgrade its system. IBM was the only vendor to succeed in completing the upgrade to SAP.

Notwithstanding the complexity of the project and its negative history, Bridgestone failed to staff the project with people who sufficiently understood its own legacy systems and could assist IBM in designing and converting them into a new SAP system. Throughout, Bridgestone lacked the necessary leadership to effectively manage the project; it replaced its CIO on six occasions in a 2 year period during the project term.

Bridgestone failed to supply the necessary software, hardware and network infrastructure for the system to operate properly. In many instances, Bridgestone supplied inferior resources or no resources at all.

There is a lot longer laundry list of complaints which you can read in the Business Insider piece, but you get IBM's gist. Bridgestone, when asked to comment on IBM's statement blaming it for all the system's resulting problems, said its only response is contained in the complaint filed with the lawsuit.

A careful reading of Bridgestone’s complaint includes all of IBM’s points above and says why the tire company thinks those points don’t hold any (legal) water. The redacted proprietary parts of the complaint (which due to someone’s poor understanding of how to use redaction in PDF documents, is easily readable) discusses what appears to be the specific promises by IBM regarding its skills and capabilities, as well as how IBM said it would manage the implementation and any problems that would arise.

Bridgestone in its complaint says that it brought the lawsuit after mediation failed. It also indicated that it was during the mediation effort that it found out “that IBM had been engaged in a course of intentional deception, fraud, and misrepresentation throughout the project.” This seems to indicate that some sort of out of court settlement, like what happened when Avantor brought a lawsuit against IBM a year ago for “reckless indifference"" on another bungled SAP project, is not likely.

How much of Bridgestone’s lawsuit will stand is anyone’s guess. Some of the specific allegations in the complaint, many of which include IBM’s representations in the redacted bits, could, to my distinctly non-lawyerly eye, be thrown out as IBM merely engaging in puffery over its skills and capabilities. That's what happened when Marin County, Calif., sued Deloitte Consulting for fraud over an SAP project in 2010. Other allegations including IBM's agreement to only use personnel possessing the proper expertise and knowledge to carry out the statement of work may be more promising.

I’ll keep you updated on the progress of both the lawsuit and public brawl.

2013-12-01T07:00:00Z,Federal Government Relaunches Health Insurance Exchange, Promises it will work this time ,,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/los-angeles-department-of-water-and-power-scrambles-to-fix-billing-system-mess,true,Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Scrambles to Fix Billing System Mess,"As it has the previous few weeks, news about the reboot of the Affordable Care Act website again overflowed the IT-related problem space last week, for the final time Obama Administration officials hope.

Obamacare website 2.0 was launched over the weekend, with the Administration claiming that the updated site is superbly better than when it was first rolled out on 1 October. For instance, according to a new Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services progress and performance report (pdf), the website's response time is now less than 1 second instead of the previous 8 seconds, the per page system times out are now only 1 percent of the time instead of over 6 percent, and some 50 000 concurrent users can now access the site, instead of the measly 500 or less on 1 October.

However, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, even as she was touting the ACA website’s “dramatic improvement,” also urged potential users to visit the ACA website during “off-peak hours when there is less traffic — mornings, evenings, or on weekends” or to “sign up for coverage… by phone, in person, and by mail. In many cases, you can also directly enroll through an insurance company.” That is probably good advice, for news reports from yesterday indicate that instead of the website being able to support 50 000 concurrent users, about 35 000 concurrent users is actually the reality.

Insurers have been less than impressed with the new and improved website, though. According to the New York Times, customers may be able to sign up for insurance, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they actually been enrolled for insurance because sign-up information isn’t reaching the insurers or the information sent contains corrupted or incomplete data. As a result, the Times reports, insurers are saying “they had received calls from consumers requesting insurance cards because they thought they had enrolled in a health plan through the federal website, but the insurers said they had not been notified.”

Insurers were also unhappy last week when the Administration announced that the back-end system needed to pay insurers was being delayed from being finished in January to a date not yet specified. The insurers have been told they now need estimate what they are owed, and then they and the government can reconcile the differences. Small businesses also joined the unhappiness queue last week, as the Administration delayed the small business health insurance exchange by a year. Also in line are Oregonians, who have seen that state’s exchange fall into a technological abyss compounded by admissions of multiple security breaches.

Despite all of this disquieting news, there is hope on the horizon, the Administration says. For according to the CMS progress and performance report, the team that is working on ACA website and back office systems “is operating with private sector velocity and effectiveness, and will continue their work to improve and enhance the website in the weeks and months ahead.” In fact, the team is making such good progress, that former Obama senior adviser David Plouffe was moved to optimistically predict on Sunday that the ACA will “work really well” by 2017. Plouffe didn’t hazard an estimate of how much getting to that state of ACA nirvana will ultimately cost in both financial and personal terms, however.

The other IT-related impediments, deficiencies and malfunctions of the week centered on the teeth-gnashing issues involving the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) new $162 million customer billing system. News reports state that over 70 000 faulty bills have been issued by its new customer information and billing system that was rolled out in September (pdf), which has led in some cases to DWP customers having their utilities incorrectly shut off. And in another bit of embarrassment for the DWP, it was scrambling to explain to LA taxpayers last week why it hid the fact that the true cost of the new billing system is nearly three times higher than what it had been previously publicly proclaiming.

Finally, last week’s IT hiccup news included various financially-related IT irritations to consumers during the annual period of U.S. shopping madness disguised as the Thanksgiving holiday, as well as hardware and software problems that accompanied the launches of the new Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One consoles.

2013-12-01T07:00:00Z,Queensland Sues IBM Over Health Payroll Debacle, IBM says it is being made a political scapegoat ,,,,,,,,,,Australia,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/ibm-sued-over-queensland-health-payroll-system-debacle,true,IBM Sued Over Queensland Health Payroll System Debacle,"It hasn’t been a good few weeks for IBM. You may recall, recently Bridgestone Tire filed a US $600 million lawsuit against IBM alleging fraud over an SAP-based invoicing, accounting, and product delivery system went that went live in January 2012 but didn’t operate as Bridgestone expected to say the least. Now news has come out that IBM is being sued by Australia’s Queensland government over its role in the disastrous Queensland Health payroll system implementation. The government wants compensation from IBM, but it did not disclosed the amount it is seeking.

As you may also remember from my years of covering this debacle, IBM was the lead contractor on the effort to replace Queensland Health’s legacy payroll system at an expected cost of A$6.19 million (fixed price) that turned into one that will cost an estimated A$1.2 billion to develop and operate properly when all is said and done. A formal commission of inquiry into the payroll system acquisition and development characterized it in its 264-page report [pdf] that was released in July as being one that “must take place in the front rank of failures in public administration in this country. It may be the worst.”

After the commission’s report was delivered, Australia’s Queensland Premier Campbell Newman banned IBM from entering into “any new contracts with the State Government until it improves its governance and contracting practices.” The ban against IBM is still in effect.

The commission of inquiry disclosed that Premier Anna Bligh’s Labor Party government, in power at the time, decided not to proceed with a lawsuit against IBM for breach of contract because it feared not only a counterclaim by IBM for unfair contract termination but also that IBM would stop work on the barely functioning payroll system. Apparently, IBM and the Labor government thought they had reached a mutually agreeable settlement where legal redress by either party against the other was ruled out—a point reiterated this week by the current Labor leader Annastacia Palaszczuk. However, the Newman Liberal Party government, seemingly believes it still has a legal case against IBM. But it risks looking foolish and wasteful of taxpayer monies if the lawsuit gets quickly thrown out of court.

IBM quickly lashed out against the Queensland government, saying that it was trying “to make IBM a political scapegoat” and “evade its settlement.” And in a standard tactic used by IT vendors to blame the customer for any failed IT project it is a party to, added, “IBM intends to vigorously defend against the government’s continued efforts to shift blame to the company for the government’s own shortcomings on the project.”

You can see another IT vendor deflecting blame onto the customer after the State of California filed a lawsuit [pdf] a few weeks ago against SAP Public Services over its role in the botched modernization of California’s MyCalPay payroll system. California hired SAP under a US $89.7 million contract in 2010 “to develop, test, deliver, and implement” the payroll system, but the state fired SAP in February for what it said were “frightening” failures. SAP had been paid about $50 million when the contract was terminated, with the state holding onto another US$7 million in payments.

California wants SAP to pay the state “at least” US$150 million in damages. (California has a right to sue for damages up to 150 percent of the contract amount.)

SAP responded to the MyCalPay lawsuit in a predictable fashion: “We will say—as we have said consistently over the course of this engagement— that SAP software is not the culprit here, nor was SAP's performance in implementing the software. Our software works exactly as it is designed and we have successfully implemented the software with other clients.""

SAP also pointed to a California state senate investigative report [pdf] from last summer that said the payroll project’s problems were because of a “lack of transparency and proper management oversight.” In other words: don’t look at us as the source of the problems, it was really all California’s fault.

SAP added that, “We stand behind our software and our actions on this project.”

I will let you know how these two lawsuits, as well as Bridgestone's, eventually turn out.","Australia,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,,Impact - Raw,payroll"

Sixty-eighth General Assembly

Fifth Committee

21st Meeting (AM)

Fifth Committee Delegates Voice Frustration at Cost Overruns,

Delays in Umoja/Enterprise Resource Planning Project

Reports on Budgets for International Trade Centre,

Peacekeeping Missions, Office of Special Adviser on Africa also Considered

During today’s meeting, Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) delegates once again voiced their frustrations with cost overruns and delays that had plagued the Secretariat’s efforts to carry out a major enterprise resource planning project aimed at streamlining administrative practices and boosting efficiency throughout the United Nations.

Known as Umoja, the massive business transformation project would help integrate administrative and support functions in five areas: finance, supply chain and procurement, human resources, central support services, and programme and project management. It would envelop more than 90 different entities around the world, including peacekeeping missions.

Yukio Takasu, Under-Secretary-General for Management, said the Secretariat was aware of Member States’ significant financial and political investment in Umoja. The project’s overall financial outlay was estimated to tally $360.9 million by year-end, up $12.8 million from the $348.1 million projected in last year’s annual progress report. That increase had been caused by the need for additional contractual services and readiness activities.

Hugh O’Farrell, Director of External Audit and Chair of the Audit Operations Committee, Board of Auditors, acknowledged the project’s history of delays and budget overruns. However, he stressed that, if carried out successfully, the project would be an opportunity to modernize the Organization’s business administration. Introducing the report of the Board of Auditors, he said that the Administration had already spent 55 per cent, or $208.8 million, of its budget. As the Board report was being finalized, two thirds of the Umoja design had been completed and the system had been half built, but not yet fully deployed.

Carlos Ruiz Massieu, Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), introduced that body’s fifth progress report on Umoja. While welcoming progress made in the last year, the Advisory Committee had noted the significant challenges and risks that remained, and had underscored the need for rigorous project planning and management, close monitoring and risk mitigation, and the prompt resolution of issues to avoid further delays and cost increases.

Speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77” developing countries and China, Fiji’s delegate welcomed the progress made in implementing the Umoja Foundation at the pilot sites, at peacekeeping operations and the Regional Service Centre at Entebbe. He agreed with the Advisory Committee and the Board that a detailed benefits realization plan was necessary. Member States needed comprehensive and timely information to help them make decisions on administrative and budget issues.

The representative of the Russian Federation also appreciated the Administration’s progress, but pointed out that the same risks that had existed last year still remained. He regretted the cost overruns and the impact the project’s delay would have on the Organization’s image.

Cameroon’s delegate, also expressing concerns about increased costs and delays, pointed out that another risk of avoiding a definite timetable was obsolescence as technology advanced. That could turn into additional investments in advanced technology.

Maria Eugenia Casar, Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Controller, introduced the Secretary-General’s report on Strengthening the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, which detailed the budget needed to help the Office carry out its expanded mandates. Additional requirements were estimated at $5.13 million (gross) for the proposed programme budget for the upcoming 2014-2015 budget cycle. That spending would be allocated for the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the Office of Central Support Services.

She also introduced the Secretariat report on the International Trade Centre, found in Section 13 of the Proposed Programme Budget for 2014-2015. The Geneva-based Centre, jointly funded by the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, was mandated to help developing countries and economies in transition integrate into the global trading system. The proposed United Nations share for the Centre’s 2014-2015 budget cycle totalled $38.98 million, before recosting, a drop of $1.16 million, or 2.9 per cent.

Speaking on behalf of the African Group, Côte d’Ivoire’s delegate said that the United Nations support for Africa was crucial as the continent passed through a social, political and economic transformation. The Group fully supported the Secretary-General’s proposals for staff and non-staff resources.

Turning to peacekeeping finance issues, Ms. Casar also introduced the Secretary-General’s revised budget report for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei for the 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 budget year. The $339.3 million budget included in the report was a 16.7 per cent, or $48.7 million, increase over the $290.6 million appropriated by General Assembly resolution 67/270. The revised budget also adhered to Security Council resolution 2104 (2013), and enabled deployment of a force protection unit of 1,126 troops for the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism.

She then introduced the Secretariat report on the revised budget for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force for the same 2013/2014 budget year. That report laid out a $60.8 million budget, up 12.8 million or 26.6 per cent, from the $48 million appropriated by the Assembly in its resolution 67/278. The revised budget provided for the deployment of an additional 203 military contingent personnel and their equipment, as well as the creation of 10 international temporary positions. Following her presentation, Mr. Ruiz Massieu introduced the Advisory Committee’s accompanying reports on peacekeeping missions.

Ethiopia’s delegate said he supported the Secretary-General’s new $339.31 million budget for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei and was concerned with the Advisory Committee’s recommendation to curb the budget by $10.2 million. The recommended cut would compromise the Mission’s mandate and did not account for its challenging environment, he added.

Representatives from Switzerland (on behalf of Lichtenstein), Japan, Sudan, and Syria also spoke today. A representative from the European Union Delegation also spoke.

The Committee will reconvene at 10 a.m. Monday, 9 December, to discuss the agenda item, Programme budget: biennium 2012-2013, and the second performance report.

Background

The Fifth Committee (Administrative and Budgetary) met today to discuss four issues: Umoja/Enterprise Resource Planning; the strengthening of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa; the financing of the International Trade Centre; and the financing of peacekeeping activities for both the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). Those topics would be included in its agenda item, proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015.

For its discussion on Umoja, the Organization’s enterprise resource planning system, the Committee would consider the Secretary-General’s Fifth progress report on the enterprise resource planning project (document A/68/375) and the addendum (document A/68/375/Add.1). It would also consider a note by the Secretary-General transmitting the Second annual progress report of the Board of Auditors on the implementation of the United Nations enterprise resource planning system (document A/68/151) as well as another Secretariat note transmitting the Joint Inspection Unit report Review of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in United Nations organizations (document A/68/344) and its addendum (document A/68/344/Add.1). The accompanying report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions (ACABQ) (document A/68/7/Add.7) also was before it.

For its discussion on Africa, the Committee would consider the Secretariat report Strengthening the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (document A/68/506) and the Advisory Committee’s accompanying document (document A/68/7/Add.8).

In order to consider funding for the International Trade Centre for the 2014-2015 biennium, the Committee would consider Section 13, International Trade Centre , which is within Part IV — International cooperation for development of the Proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 (document A/68/6(Sect.13)/Add.1) and the Seventh report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 Section 13, International Trade Centre (document A/68/7/Add.6)

Regarding financing of the peacekeeping missions, the Committee had before it the Secretariat report Revised budget for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (document A/68/519)and (document A/68/620). It would also consider the Secretary-General’s report, Revised budget for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (document A/68/505) and the eponymous report of the Advisory Committee (document A/68/617).

Umoja /Enterprise Resource Planning

YUKIO TAKASU, Under-Secretary-General for Management, introduced the Secretary-General’s fifth progress report on Umoja, the Organization’s enterprise resource planning initiative, and its accompanying addendum (document A/68/375 and Add.1). He noted significant progress since the Assembly had approved the project’s revised deployment strategy and timetable at its last session. The Umoja Foundation was successfully deployed on 1 July this year at its pilot locations: United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon (UNSCOL). The successful rollout on 1 November of Cluster 1, including at 12 peacekeeping operations, the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe, and the Global Service Centre in Brindisi, was a major milestone. Umoja, now a fully operational live system, covering 3,000 staff worldwide, was at the centre of the Secretary-General’s management reform initiatives.

“As the project owner, I assure you that Umoja is receiving the highest attention throughout the Secretariat,” he said. Through it, the Organization was harmonizing administrative processes; building standardized, integrated service delivery; and creating opportunities for improved oversight. The implementation strategy had proved highly valuable. Lessons learned from the pilot in July had supported the successful go-live in peacekeeping missions in November. Notably, the business readiness activities associated with migrating from disparate operating models to a single, common operating model proved more challenging than expected; data reconciliation and data cleansing were extremely complex.

As noted in the addendum, he continued, the Steering Committee had decided this past August that deployment would occur in Cluster 1 (peacekeeping operations) on 1 November, this year, and in Cluster 2 (special political missions) on 1 February 2014. That decision was based on the experience of the recent pilot at UNIFIL in July, particularly with business readiness activities. However, when more areas were identified in need of adjustment following the Cluster 1 rollout in November, the Steering Committee decided to deploy Cluster 2 on 1 March 2014, together with Extension 1 pilot at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). In the past year, governance, including the concept of “process ownership”, was considerably strengthened. To expedite engagement of non-peacekeeping entities, a business re-engineering group was set up to help departments and offices prepare for and deploy Clusters 3 and 4.

He went on to say that Umoja’s successful implementation would lead to some immediate qualitative benefits. Still, quantitative benefits would not occur until the project was fully stabilized and the Secretariat was in a position to fully implement all the related organizational adjustments. For peacekeeping operations, benefits would start in the 2016/2017 budget cycle; for all entities under the regular budget, benefits would start in 2017. “In line with last year’s projections, the Secretary-General is fully committed to delivering quantitative benefits ranging from $140 million to $220 million by 2019,” he emphasized.

The Secretary-General was mindful of Member States’ significant financial and political investment in Umoja, he noted. Overall requirements were currently projected at $360.9 million, a $12.8 million increase over the $348.1 million projected in last year’s annual progress report. The increase was due to higher requirements for additional contractual services and readiness activities. At this stage, however, the Secretary-General was not seeking funding for the extra amount. Instead, all efforts were being made to contain costs through 2014. Update requirements for 2015, as well as projected resource requirements for 2016 and 2017, would be presented in the sixth annual progress report.

The report outlined a plan to re-profile the Umoja project team to meet changing needs in implementation, he said, stressing the Organization’s intention to ensure that the project’s skills requirements were met increasingly by internal rather than external resources. In the next two years, the Umoja team expected to face “far larger and more complex and challenging” tasks to implementation at Headquarters and offices away from Headquarters in Clusters 3 and 4. The proposed upgrade of the post of the Project Deputy Director from D-1 to D-2 level would strengthen day-to-day management and allow the Deputy Director to focus on engagement with senior management to drive organizational readiness.

HUGH O’FARRELL, Director of External Audit and Chair of the Audit Operations Committee, Board of Auditors, introduced the Secretary-General’s note transmitting the Board of Auditor’s second annual progress report on the implementation of the United Nations enterprise resource planning system (document A/68/151). He said the proposed $378 million project would span administrative and support functions in five areas — finance, supply chain and procurement, human resources, central support services, and programme and project management — and would envelop more than 90 different entities. It was a challenging and complex project and the Organization’s most important business transformation.

While noting the history of delays and cost increases, he said that the project, if implemented successfully, was an essential opportunity to modernize the Organization’s business administration. The Administration had responded positively to the recommendations of the Board’s last report and had taken actions that placed the project on sounder footing. Yet, such progress had left the project team overstretched and severely fatigued at a point where the challenges were about to increase exponentially.

The Administration had spent 55 per cent, or $208.8 million, of its budget, he continued. When the report was being prepared, two thirds of the design was complete and the system was half built, but not yet fully deployed. There was still no integrated plan linking spending to deliverables, which made it difficult to judge what progress should have been achieved for the $208.8 million invested to date.

“We cannot at this point provide assurance that the ERP [enterprise resource planning] project will successfully deliver its full functionality within the existing forecasts of time or cost,” he said. Regarding the procurement of services, the Board concluded that the lack of an overall commercial strategy at Umoja’s inception had led to difficulties in engaging the market to secure optimal value for money from vendors. Since the audit, the Administration had informed the Board that it had given the Steering Committee a plan to develop a commercial strategy for remaining procurements. The Board would return to the issue during its next audit.

The wider Administration, he said, needed to keep developing benefit realization plans that would pinpoint the type of benefits, and exactly how and when the estimated annual financial benefits of $140 million to $220 million would be achieved, whether through streamlined processes requiring less staff, or the use of improved management information to improve decision-making. The Administration was urged to articulate the financial, quantitative and qualitative improvements to service delivery brought about by the new enterprise resource planning. Thus, it was important to have a future “target operating model” of the United Nations that the project, and other transformation initiatives, would support. That would help secure support by stakeholders, avoid expensive retooling and enhance accountability for delivery.

CARLOS RUIZ MASSIEU, Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, introduced that body’s fifth progress report on Umoja (document A/68/7/Add.7). He welcomed the advancement during the reporting period, commending all involved in deploying the Umoja Foundation at the pilot sites and the peacekeeping missions in Cluster 1. That initial deployment was a “key milestone” in the project’s life cycle and should assure Member States of the effectiveness of the project’s viability and leadership. Noting the significant remaining challenges and risks, he stressed the need for rigorous project planning and management, close monitoring and risk mitigation, and prompt resolution of issues in order to avoid further delays and cost escalation. Also important were the roles and responsibilities of the project owner and the Steering Committee in guiding and overseeing the management of implementing the project, fostering cooperation with relevant Secretariat departments/offices and facilitating decision-making.

The report had stressed the importance of setting benefits realization targets, he said. It had recommended that the Assembly ask the Secretary-General to ensure that heads of implementing departments/offices were fully engaged in the process and that the project enjoyed high levels of collaboration and cooperation throughout the Secretariat. The project owner and process owners must be granted the requisite level of authority to implement the changes to Umoja business processes and working methods. Concrete information on Umoja’s quantitative and qualitative benefits needed to be provided in upcoming budget proposals as well as the performance reports for peacekeeping operations as early as possible, but no later than the 2016/2017 period. Further, the Assembly should ask the Secretary-General to ensure that the enterprise resource planning system give Member States comprehensive, high-quality, accurate and timely information to facilitate decision-making on administrative and budgetary proposals.

The full scope and functionality of the Umoja Foundation’s Extension 1 and 2 phases must be delivered in order to protect Member States’ investment and realize Umoja’s expected benefits, he said. He cautioned against any approach that would result in any de-scoping of the project, particularly Umoja Extension 2, which comprised some of the key functions to be automated, such as planning and programming, supply chain management and budget formulation. As previously recommended, the project team should be maintained until completion of Extension 2. Premature dismantling could cause Extension 2 not to be effectively implemented. Still, maintaining the team did not preclude the need to adjust the team’s size and composition or to contain costs and provide the most required expertise in-house.

In that regard, he welcomed the steps taken to strengthen in-house skills in the enterprise resource planning software and encouraged their further development. Also welcomed and encouraged was increased coordination and cooperation between the Umoja project and the Office of Information and Communications Technology as well as with the Department of Field Support’s Information and Communications Technology Division. The Secretary-General’s pragmatic approach to address indirect costs and to clearly establish the roles and responsibilities of implementing departments/offices as well as the methods for funding preparatory activities was welcomed, as well. He recalled that the Assembly had been recommended to ask the Secretary-General to capture information and report on the level and nature of indirect costs of preparatory activities. In addition, there was a need to bolster collaboration between the Secretariat and other United Nations entities using the enterprise resource planning solution.

JOANNA FIODOROW, Fifth Committee Vice-Chair, then drew the Committee’s attention to the Secretary-General’s note (document A/68/344) that transmitted the Joint Inspection Unit report titled “Review of enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in the United Nations organizations) as well as the Joint Inspection Unit’s introductory statement. Also brought before the Committee was the Secretary-General’s note (document A/68/344/Add.1) transmitting his comments and those of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination on the Joint Inspection Unit’s report and corresponding introductory statement.

LUKE DAUNIVALU ( Fiji ), speaking on behalf of the “Group of 77”, developing countries and China, welcomed the progress in implementing the Umoja Foundation at the pilot sites, peacekeeping operations, and the Regional Service Centre at Entebbe. Such achievements were particularly notable considering the difficult situation the project had faced since its inception. He also noted the actions to strengthen the project’s governance arrangements in response to Assembly resolution 66/246. However, despite good progress, he cited issues concerning organizational readiness, handling of procurement contracts, possible delays in implementing the project schedule, building the necessary in-house expertise, adequacy of the information and communications technology structure, and resources in the Organization. He looked forward to receiving more information on those and other issues from the Secretariat during the informal sessions, as well as details on the rollout of the Umoja Foundation at all peacekeeping missions and an update on the status of preparatory activities for implementation at special political missions in February 2014. Lessons learned from those initial steps were fundamental for strengthening project implementation.

He concurred with ACABQ and the Board on the importance of a detailed benefits realization plan. More clarity on the use of data from enterprise resource planning and on the potential impact of more efficient administrative processes was vital to better understand the implications of Umoja implementation. He supported ACABQ’s recommendation of providing Member States with comprehensive, high-quality, accurate and timely information to facilitate consideration and decision-making on administrative and budgetary proposals. Still, there was concern regarding the considerable weaknesses in the project’s initial phases that had led to inefficient resource use. Management failures had caused implementation delays and cost overruns. The Group would follow that issue closely and seek assurances that similar problems did to occur in Umoja or other initiatives. Strong leadership was essential for successfully managing and delivering such a complex, organization-wide business transformation. In that regard, he welcomed the information on the future Umoja support team, but shared ACABQ’s concern on the risks of dismantling the project team prematurely.

FRANCESCO PRESUTTI, a representative of the European Union Delegation, expressed his continued support of Umoja and its potential for business transformation within the United Nations system. He welcomed the progress achieved thus far and commended all those involved for their commitment. The Secretary-General should closely monitor the design and deployment of Umoja and ensure strict management of the implementation timetable and costs of the project. Current projections that showed an increase in the overall requirements was a worrisome trend. Oversight and risk management of the project should continue to be adequate and senior management in all departments of the Secretariat should be fully committed to the project’s deployment. As well, process owners should be granted the authority to implement changes. Umoja could only succeed if the project was fully implemented, thus protecting the investment already made by Member States and enabling the expected benefits of the system to be fully realized.

Ms. SCHWEIZER ( Switzerland ), also speaking for Lichtenstein, emphasized the importance of ensuring that every experience in implementing Umoja received proper analysis in order to draw useful lessons for subsequent phases. The transition to new working methods and new information and communication technologies systems made the deployment of Umoja highly complex. Every unanticipated event during its implementation had repercussions. As well, subsequent problems during future phases could not be overlooked. Furthermore, the transition to Umoja would have a significant impact on the day-to-day management of peacekeeping operations. It was important that the essential mandates of those operations not be affected by Umoja’s execution. On another note, other problems remained, including the risk of schedule and budget overruns, and a lack of acceptance on the project. As the United Nations Board of Auditors has stressed, it was disconcerting that no detailed project plan and no clarity regarding the utilized budget and project stages has been achieved, especially considering that 55 per cent of the financial resources for Umoja had already been spent. A detailed project plan and a methodology that would facilitate clear links between the budget and defined project stages were urgently needed.

SHO ONO ( Japan ) welcomed the progress achieved over the past year, including the successful launch of Umoja at the pilot sites and their supporting offices at Headquarters, and later at peacekeeping missions and the Regional Service Centre in Entebbe. Acknowledging the work of all staff on the endeavour, he said he looked forward to receiving updated information on the project’s roll-out in peacekeeping missions and the status of preparation activities for its implementation in special political missions, which was to be rolled out on 1 February 2014.

He went on to say that the project’s full scope should be delivered while adhering to the timetable and costs. Close attention had to be paid to coordinating the Organization’s readiness at each implementation location to ensure a smooth deployment of systems, limit the burdens on end-users and avoid disrupting operational activities. Echoing the Advisory Committee, he urged the Secretariat to explore ways to reflect, in the budget, the expected savings stemming from implementing Umoja. That should be reported in relevant Secretariat reports as soon as possible. The project’s overall costs by 2015 had increased by about $12.7 million since the last Secretary-General report, mainly due to increases in contractual services and furniture and equipment. He again agreed with the Advisory Committee that a detailed implementation plan was needed to determine what work remained and the accompanying costs.

“With such a fundamental tool, the risks of incremental increases and unpredictability of costs could be resolved,” he said. He requested that details of the timeline and the total costs incurred to complete the design of the Umoja Foundation, Extensions 1 and 2, as well as an assessment of how delays in finalizing the Umoja design affected the overall timeline and budget, be included in the Secretary-General’s next report.

SERGEY A. SAFRONOV ( Russian Federation ), thanking the Administration for its reports, noted that some progress had been made in the Umoja project, which had helped boost the confidence of Member States. Yet, the risks that existed last year still existed. Work would be carried out at the same time in each cluster of the project. He regretfully noted that the project’s cost level would reach $360 million through December of this year. The cost was not to go above $248.3 million, and he expressed his opposition to additional project increases. In addition, the associated costs issue was still open. That was a concern for Member States. He supported the recommendations of the Board of Auditors. The impact of Umoja’s progress on the Organization’s image also was a concern. Any changes had to take place with the agreement of Member States.

MICHEL TOMMO MONTHE ( Cameroon ) reiterated the encouragement that his delegation had made to Secretariat officials after Umoja had been derailed. He noted that project teams had been reconstructed, moving the project forward. That showed a spirit of togetherness. Observing that there had been a phase when Member States and the Administration had been very discouraged, he stressed that a firm and clear timeline needed to be developed. A vague timetable without definite goals would lead to increased costs and Member States would tire of that situation. Between now and 2015, very tangible results had to be achieved so that Member States could support the project. Another risk of not following a definite timetable was that Umoja could become obsolete because of technological advancements, thus making it necessary for the Secretariat to buy more technology. In addition, the Organization had to know what information and technology was being left behind, and what information was being taken forward. The United Nations was a very complex organization and it needed to engage the very best technicians and work with people whom had institutional memory. It had to adapt to technological change.

Office of Special Adviser on Africa/International Trade Centre

MARÍA EUGENIA CASAR, Assistant Secretary-General and United Nations Controller, introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the Strengthening of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (document A/68/506). The report detailed the budgetary requirements for strengthening the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa to enable the Office to implement its expanded mandates. Additional requirements were estimated at $5.13 million (gross) or $4.76 million (net of staff assessment) for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015. That spending would be allocated for the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the Office of Central Support Services.

Also in the report, she pointed out, the Secretary-General proposed the establishment of 10 new posts, comprising six programme officers at the P-5, P-4 and P-3 levels; two Economic Affairs officers at the P-3 and P-2 levels; one communications officer at the P-4 level; and one senior staff assistant (General Service). In addition, the Office required resources for organizing consultative meetings relating to the United Nations monitoring mechanism mandated by the General Assembly in its resolution 66/293 in the amount of $338,000. It also required resources for travel to reinforce its capacity in advocacy and communications in the amount of $293,600.

She then introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the Proposed Programme Budget for 2014-2015 for Section 13 on the International Trade Centre (document A/68/6 (Sect. 13)/Add.1). That centre was responsible for the implementation of subprogramme 6, Operational aspects of trade promotion and export development; and of programme 10, Trade and development, of the strategic framework for the period 2014-2015. The United Nations and the World Trade Organization equally shared the funding of the International Trade Centre’s regular budget, as the Centre was a joint body of both Organizations, mandated to provide technical assistance to facilitate the integration of developing countries and economies in transition. It was particularly responsible with assisting least developed countries entering the multilateral trading system through export promotion and international business development.

The proposed overall level of resources for the biennium 2014-2015 for the Centre amounted to 73,209,300 Swiss francs, before recosting. The proposed United Nations share for the biennium 2014-2015 for the Centre, amounted to $38.98 million, before recosting, reflecting a decrease of $1.16 million or 2.9 per cent as compared to the revised appropriation for the biennium 2012-2013, which amounted to $40.14 million.

Mr. RUIZ MASSIEU took the floor again to introduce the Advisory Committee’s reports on Strengthening the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (document A/68/7/Add.8) and the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 for the International Trade Centre (A/68/6 (Sect. 13/Add.1).

In regards to the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, he said the Advisory Committee regretted that no action had been taken to appropriately reallocate resources within the regular budget, during the 2012-2013 biennium, to let the Office fulfil its mandate effectively. There was no objection to the new posts proposed by the Secretary-General, with the exception of the one post of senior staff assistant (General Service (Principal level)). The functions of that post could be performed with the Office’s existing staff. The Office was expected to keep controlling costs associated with holding consulting meetings with various stakeholders, including such meetings at the Economic Commission on Africa conference centre in Addis Ababa. Also recommended was a 5 per cent reduction in staff travel requirements, which was in line with its recommendations for all other budget sections in 2014-2015.

Turning to the International Trade Centre budget issues, Mr. Ruiz Massieu commended the efficiency measures that had produced a reduction in the Centre’s staff requirements by two administrative posts at the General Service level. Regarding the P-5 post, the report recommended that pertinent recruitment, rules and regulations be applied as if it were a new post, since the post had not been approved under the regular budget. Also recommended was the same 5 per cent reduction in staff travel requirements for the Centre. The Secretary-General was urged as well to intensify his efforts to simplify the administrative arrangements under which the Committee reviewed the Centre’s budget, so that just one review would be completed by the Committee in the year preceding the financial period.

Mr. DAUNIVALU ( Fiji ), taking the floor again on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, said that in the last decade Africa had undergone significant social, political and economic changes, including high economic growth, strengthened democracy and a significant reduction in conflicts. Still, among its continued challenges, the continent had not experienced meaningful employment creation or substantial poverty reduction. Thus, he fully supported the Secretary-General’s proposal to strengthen the Office to enable it to implement its existing and new expanded mandate more effectively. The Office’s very limited resources were not enough to implement its new additional mandate as staff was fully engaged in implementing the existing mandate.

The Group attached as much importance to the International Trade Centre as it did the Office, he said. The Centre’s mandated activities of fostering sustainable economic development and helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals in developing countries and countries with economies in transition through international trade and business had proven very effective. The Centre should be given the appropriate resources to continue performing its mandate uninterrupted. He also said that the Group would closely analyze the Secretary-General’s proposed reductions in post and non-post resources for the biennium 2014-2015, and seek explanations for the Centre’s high vacancy rate. As well, the Centre’s management was encouraged to step up efforts to reduce the gender and nationality gap among senior managers in order to improve representation from the developing world.

BROUZ RALPH ENNERIC COFFI, (Côte d’Ivoire), speaking on behalf of the African Group, noted that, since the establishment of the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa 10 years ago, the continent had undergone a significant transformation marked by major social, political and economic changes. The support of the United Nations was of key importance as it would further enhance the current rapid transformation of Africa. Such changes would, in turn, present new opportunities and challenges requiring the Office to expand, strengthen its activities and broaden its engagement. He also noted that the Office had suffered negatively from the lack of senior leadership in recent years and he welcomed the initiative taken by the Secretary General to respond to Member States mandates and calls from experts and intergovernmental bodies on strengthening the activities of the Office.

He went on to say he fully supported the Secretary-General’s proposal on post and non-post resources for strengthening the Office in the areas of policy analysis, monitoring and research, intergovernmental support, advocacy and inter-agency coordination. The Secretary-General’s proposal for establishing 10 additional posts in the Office was also welcomed. Strengthening the Office should be commensurate with the mandates entrusted to it and all posts requested and approved must be filled as a matter of priority and in full compliance with existing provisions, including geographical and gender balances. Noting that no meaningful progress had been made with regard to technology transfer in recent years, he urged the Office to continue it efforts in that area. He also said that the Group would scrutinize comments, observations and recommendations of the Advisory Committee with the aim of making an informed decision and will further analyze how all previous mandates have been incorporated in the current proposal.

Mr. MONTHE ( Cameroon ) said that the Under-Secretary-General responsible for the Office and other top management officials had always been very attentive and well meaning. He also noted ACABQ’s support in that regard. A look at the Office’s evolution since its inception showed that it had reached its lowest point when the Secretary-General had considered merging it with the Office of the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small island Developing States. Wise counsel had prompted him to re-launch the Africa Office in a way that enabled it to reach its highest point. He called for a strong focal point to address Africa issues and consider how major United Nations bodies dealt with them. That was crucial as structural changes in the 1980s had put several African countries in a difficult situation and subsequent processes had to be implemented to assist Africa. He was pleased that the Secretary-General had kept his word and had stressed the need to bolster the Africa Office. The Committee should support the recommendations of ACABQ and the Secretary-General regarding the requisite material, financial and human resource materials to strengthen the Office and ask for accountability in return. He expected tangible results in that regard.

Financing of Peacekeeping Operations

Ms. CASAR then took the floor again and introduced the Secretary-General’s revised budget report for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (document A/68/519). She said that the budget amounted to $339.3 million dollars, representing an increase of $48.7 million (16.7 per cent) from the amount of $290.6 million appropriated by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/270 for the maintenance of the mission for the same period. Pursuit to Security Council resolution 2104 (2013), the revised 2013/14 budget provided for the deployment of a force protection unit of 1,126 troops for the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism and reflected an increase in assets and construction expense in line with the deployment of additional personnel to four locations.

She then introduced the Secretary-General’s report on the revised budget for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014 (A/68/617), saying that the budget amounted to $60.8 million, representing an increase of $12.8 million (26.6 per cent) from the amount of $48 million appropriated by the General Assembly in its resolution 67/278. Pursuant to the Security Council resolution 2108 (2013), the revised 2013/14 budget provided for the deployment of an additional 203 military contingent personnel and their equipment, as well as the related proposed establishment of 10 international temporary positions.

Mr. RUIZ MASSIEU, taking the floor again for ACABQ, introduced that body’s reports on the revised budget for UNISFA (document A/68/620) and for UNDOF (document A/68/617), both for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2012. Regarding UNISFA, ACABQ recommended a $10.2 million reduction to the proposed revised budget for the 2013/2104 period due to vacancy rates for new international staff posts and military observers and contingents, as well as under the construction category. Specifically, it recommended a 30 per cent vacancy rate for new and continuing international staff posts, and adjustment to the proposed revised budget to reflect expenditure for military observers and contingents for the first half of the 2013/2014 period based on actual average vacancy rates. Further, it recommended a $5.9 million reduction in the construction category due to performance in the current period and the magnitude of the increase requested for this period.

On UNDOF, he said ACABQ had no objection to the resources proposed by the Secretary-General for deploying additional military contingent personnel and enhancing UNDOF’s security and safety. However, some of the proposed requirements could have been partially offset by under-expenditure under the appropriation for national staff due to the actual higher-than-budgeted vacancy rate. ACABQ therefore recommended that the Secretary-General be asked to adjust budgetary resources for national staff on the basis of a 9 per cent vacancy rate in the 2013/2014 period.

Mr. COFFI ( Côte d'Ivoire ), speaking on behalf of the African Group, expressed concern over recent attacks against United Nations peacekeepers. He then took note of the Secretary-General’s proposal on revised estimates for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei as well as for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, noting also the Advisory Committee’s comments, observations and recommendations. Reassuring the Group’s intention to carefully examine the proposals and to ensure that adequate resources would be allocated to effectively deliver respective mandates, he reiterated that body’s willingness to engage in negotiations with the aim to achieve a positive outcome in a timely manner.

AMAN HASSEN ( Ethiopia ), recalling Security Council resolution 2104 (2013) which authorized the increment of troops from 4,200 to 5,326, said that in addition, 34 civilian personnel had been requested to support the increase in troop strength and the deployment of the Joint Border Verification and Monitoring Mechanism to four locations. Further, it was imperative to acquire vehicles and a helicopter to enable the Joint Border sector headquarters to operate self-sufficiently, especially given the difficulty of sharing support equipment. The deployment of personnel would also necessitate an increase in requirements for construction services. Therefore, he supported the Secretary-General’s revised resources proposal amounting to $339.31 million and noted with concern ACABQ’s recommendation for a reduction of $10.2 million. The recommended cut compromised the mandate delivery of the Mission and did not take into account the challenging environment it faced.

ARWA ANWAR MOHAMED SALIH ( Sudan ), aligning herself with the African Group, regretted the long-standing crisis related to the delay in releasing documents on the agenda item for discussion. Her delegation was coordinating with the Office of Human Resources Management to ensure the accuracy of its data in the related reports. She noted that UNISFA’s mandate had been extended until 30 May 2014 per Security Council resolution 2126 (2013), and she paid tribute to Ethiopia for the outstanding performance of its air force in the Mission. She also thanked the African Union for seeking a sustainable solution to the situation in Abyei. Increased funds were needed to create new civilian posts to support military personnel in UNISFA and to carry out pressing construction work in four locations. In view of the region’s poor infrastructure, she called on Member States to provide the necessary resources so that UNISFA could fulfil its mandate properly. Therefore, she rejected the proposed reductions in ACABQ’s report and called for a painstaking study on those recommendations. As well, she was concerned over the high vacancy rate for civilian and military posts and would request clarification on that during the Committee’s informal session.

ISMAIL BASSEL AYZOUKI ( Syria ) said the inception of UNDOF was related to Israel’s 1967 occupation of the Golan. Israel was the occupier and the aggressor and refused to withdraw from the occupied territory. In addition, the Israeli occupation was an active aggression against the Untied Nations forces. He emphasized that Israel’s actions were in violation of international law and had threatened the life of Mission staff. His country had continued to respect the separation of forces, as it wanted to achieve a fair and just peace that followed all relevant resolutions. He pointed out that Syria had recommended the creation of the Mission and fully supported it.

We start off this week’s review of IT hiccups with the UK National Air Traffic Services (NATS) nighttime to daytime operations switchover that didn’t happen as scheduled at 0600 London time Saturday morning. As a result of the failure, which affected controller communications, hundreds of domestic and international flights into and out of the UK and Ireland were delayed and many cancelled. NATS went to its back-up system, which allowed it to operate at about 80 percent of capacity; full operations were not restored until 1900 Saturday night. The effects of the problems were felt well into Sunday.

Early last Monday evening, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group's computer systems, which support RBS along with the two other banks (NatWest and Ulster Bank), went down for three hours, halting all three banks' financial transactions. The banks’ 15.7 million customers were not amused, it being Cyber Monday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year. As you may recall, the RBS Group suffered a massive computer system meltdown in June 2012 that lasted nearly two months before it was fully straightened out. That snafu was preceded by a major outage in November 2011. Bank CEO Ross McEwan apologized for the latest cock-up, blaming it on RBS failing to “invest properly” in its IT systems “for decades.” I am sure that apology was just the tonic to mollify customer anger. Just to add to the fun, on Wednesday, the three banks’ online systems were unavailable for about an hour because of a denial of service attack.

Also last week, the German-owned gas and electricity supplier Npower sent out letters to its 3.4 million English and Welsh customers apologizing for “service issues resulting from the installation of a new billing system and a promise that customers will not lose out financially as a direct result of these issues.” It is estimated that over a million Npower customers either owe money or are owed money because of problems with the £200 million billing system that was installed in 2011. At the time, Npower was bragging that because of its deliberate approach, it wasn’t expecting any problems with its roll out.

Lest we forget, the Affordable Care Act website that was rebooted 10 days ago hasn’t fully escaped the IT-related problem orbit. The good news is that people are increasingly able to enroll for health insurance through the federal website, with more enrollments in two days after the reboot than all of October, when it was first launched. The bad news is that, of the 127 000 people who enrolled through the website in October and November, roughly one-fourth of their applications contained errors. The result: enrollees may not have insurance even though they think they do. The reboot has reduced the error rate to “only” 10 percent, the Obama Administration says, but with many more folks being able to sign up, that may not be exactly positive news. In addition, the Administration is now trying to discourage the use of paper ACA applications “because of concerns those applications would not be processed in time.”

State health insurance exchanges in Maryland and Oregon continue to have problems, while in California, the exchange secretly sent the names, addresses, phone numbers and addresses of tens of thousands to insurance agents of anyone who started a health insurance application, even if they didn’t complete it. That news hasn’t gone over well, even though California says that what it did is perfectly legal.

Finally, today is Grace Hopper’s 107th birthday, appropriately marked by a Google Doodle. I was privileged to meet her twice when I worked as an electronic engineer for the Department of the Navy in the 1970s; she was truly a remarkable person.

Federal health officials are preparing to sign early next week a 12-month contract worth roughly $90 million with a different company, Accenture, after concluding that CGI has not been effective enough in fixing the intricate computer system underpinning the federal Web site, according to a person familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss private negotiations.

Accenture, one of the world’s largest consulting firms, has extensive experience with computer systems on the state level and built California’s large new health-insurance exchange. But it has not done substantial work on any Health and Human Services Department program.

The administration’s decision to end the contract with CGI reflects lingering unease over the performance of HealthCare.gov even as officials have touted recent improvements and the rising numbers of Americans who have used the marketplace to sign up for health coverage that took effect Jan. 1.

The government is able to sever its relationship with CGI readily because the company’s contract to work on the exchange is to run out at the end of February. Federal officials had the option of extending it for another year and possibly two more times, or of not renewing it. While rejecting a year’s extension, federal officials are discussing with company executives ways to try to ensure a smooth transition, according to individuals familiar with the conversations.

View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points.

Aaron Albright, a spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that oversees the new online marketplace, did not confirm the decision to switch IT contractors but said, “We continually evaluate our needs and remain focused on ensuring consumers have access to affordable, quality coverage.”

A CGI spokeswoman, Linda Odorisio, acknowledged Friday that the company’s work on HealthCare.gov was ending but said in a statement:“We are proud that more than 400 CGI employees worked around the clock from October through December to deliver a consumer experience that works for a vast majority of Americans.” She noted that the company will continue to perform other work for CMS, including nearly $37 million in contracts that the company has been given during the past few months.

Accenture declined to comment. “We are in discussions with potential clients all the time, but it is not appropriate to discuss with the media contracts we may or may not be discussing,” Accenture spokeswoman Joanne Veto said in a brief telephone interview.

At the beginning of December, administration officials announced that the Web site was largely working for consumers who wanted to enroll in health plans. But the site continues to malfunction in other ways. For instance, it is not yet able to automatically enroll people eligible for Medicaid in states’ programs, compute exact amounts to be sent to insurers for their customers’ federal subsidies or tabulate precisely how many consumers have paid their insurance premiums and are therefore covered.

According to officials familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision is not yet public, leaders of CMS became frustrated with the pace and quality of CGI’s work on the repairs. As federal officials and contractors have been trying to fix various aspects of the Web site in the past few months, about half the new software code the company has written failed when it was first used, according to internal federal information.

CGI Federal was hired Sept. 30, 2011, as the main contractor to build one of the most complex computer systems the federal government has ever attempted to create. The company’s failure to deliver on key aspects of the project was a main reason behind the site’s botched Oct. 1 launch, when error messages were generated when many consumers tried to shop for and select health plans online. President Obama described the launch as one of his “fumbles,” while Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius called it a “debacle.”

Late last summer, as federal health officials were worrying that construction of the Web site was running far behind schedule, CGI executives promised CMS that they could deliver a functioning marketplace by the Oct. 1 start date. But by the week before the launch, the company had failed to deliver on 45 percent of the components for which it was responsible, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post.

The fact that there is now a transition period of less than two months before Accenture takes over — significantly shorter than ideal for major IT projects — presents its own challenges for the federal officials and contractors and requires coordination between the outgoing and incoming firms.

Because of time constraints, CMS is awarding the Accenture contract on a sole-source basis, according to the person familiar with the decision.

The switch in contractors for the online marketplace reflects the administration’s broader effort to reassess how it handles its $80 billion-a-year IT contracting operations, now that HealthCare.gov’s performance is improving and more than 1 million Americans have selected plans on the exchange. The administration replaced the contractor that maintains the computer servers handling the data generated by HealthCare.gov, switching from Verizon’s Terremark to Hewlett-Packard. And it is preparing to sign a contract affirming that Quality Software Services, which took over as the project’s general contractor in late October, will stay on for at least another year to coordinate the system’s operation.

The White House is also debating how it can change the way it handles technology projects government-wide, officials said, including proposals to establish an office that oversees IT ventures across agencies. Other changes include allowing agencies to circumvent the Office of Personnel Management’s hiring process by directly retaining software experts and rotating government technologists through stints in the private sector.

The decision to switch contractors for HealthCare.gov is unlikely to tamp down persistent Republican criticism of the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 statute that created the new marketplace. “A change in contractors does not change the sad state of this law,” said Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

In turning to Accenture, CMS is placing the project in the hands of a government contractor that has significant technological expertise but which also signed a high-profile legal settlement with the Justice Department less than three years ago over its contracting practices. The global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing firm lately has worked extensively to upgrade and modernize some states’ social services systems, several in anticipation of the health-care law’s rollout.

Accenture was hired by the Internal Revenue Service in 2009 to work on the temporary expansion of a health-care tax credit that was part of federal policy to stimulate the economy.

In June 2012, California entered into a $359 million contract with the company to build the state’s health-care marketplace and operate it for 3 1/ 2 years. Accenture developed the marketplace, called Covered California, along with CGI , which served as one of its subcontractors.

Covered California is the largest of 14 state-run insurance exchanges, and it has worked relatively smoothly since it was launched at the same time as the federal marketplace. By late December, more than 400,000 Californians had enrolled.

In other instances, Accenture has sparred with CGI as the firms have competed for technology projects.

In the fall of 2012, Accenture finished an online human-services eligibility project for Iowa, modernizing a nearly 20-year-old system in less than a year. In February, it won a $230 million grant to overhaul the technology behind Ohio’s Medicaid program and to create a streamlined online application process for several state aid programs.

The company’s contracting dispute with the federal government ended with Accenture agreeing in September 2011 to pay $63 million to settle a Justice Department lawsuit alleging that it improperly benefited from recommending specific hardware and software as part of government contracts, as well as by inflating prices on contracts and distorting the federal bidding process. The firm, one of several contractors targeted by federal authorities, denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

2014-01-01T07:00:00Z,"GM Recalls 370,000 Pickup Trucks for Software Update to Reduce Fire Risk", Recall hits 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra ,370000,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Auto and Land Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/gm-recalls-370-000-pickup-trucks-for-software-update-to-reduce-fire-risk,,GM Recalls 370 000 Pickup Trucks for Software Update to Reduce Fire Risk,"There were a wide-variety of errors, faults, and general IT-related ooftas to choose from last week. But GM’s recall of 370 000 of its 2014 model year Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra full-size pickup trucks, in order to update their software and reduce the likelihood that their exhaust systems will overheat and catch fire, caught our eye. According to the Detroit News, “When [a] truck idles, it should use two cylinders…but because of a software glitch, the recalled trucks idle with most of the cylinders. That causes the vehicles to overheat and leads to the fires.” So far, there have been eight reported fires, but no injuries.

All of the affected trucks have V-8 engines, but the recall is also being extended to trucks with V-6 engines. Owners should be on the watch for a continuously yellow “check engine light” and an “engine power reduced” message on the vehicle’s information center, the News reported. GM is also telling truck owners not to leave their trucks to idle unattended, which they may do especially in colder climates while warming them up.

The recall is a bit of an embarrassment for GM, because the Silverado, a highly popular and profitable product for GM, is also one of three finalists for the North American Truck of the Year award that is to be announced later today. [Update: the Silverado did win Truck of the Year.] Owners of the affected vehicles will be notified later this week about when they can come in for the software update. The procedure should only take 20 minutes or so to complete.

Your Flight Will Take Off When We Locate the Crew

The recent cold and wintery weather has made flying in the U.S. and Canada a most unpleasant experience for many travelers. While the weather has been responsible for over 20 000 canceled flights and 40 000 delays since the first of the year, Bloomberg News reported that problems with United Airlines’ Crew Communication System (CCS), which is used to communicate schedules and other information to its onboard personnel, has added to the woes. According to Bloomberg, on 30 December 2013, all 10 200 of the airline’s pilots were shifted to the crew communication system previously used only by Continental Airlines pilots. You may recall that United and Continental merged in 2010, and that the merger of their automated reservation systems wasn’t the smoothest on record. Further complicating the transition was a CCS software update designed to comply with a new federal requirement, which came into effect on 4 January, that limits the number of consecutive hours a given pilot can be on duty.

However, Bloomberg reports, since the shift, the CCS has been prone to crashing and displaying out of date crew scheduling information. As a result, the system has lost track of crews' whereabouts, left them stranded, or made them late for flights, leading to both flight cancellations and delays, Bloomberg claims. United acknowledges there have been some technical issues with the CSS, but denies it has lost or stranded crews. United told Reuters that most of the reported crew problems were due to weather, not CCS, issues.

In other air travel news, a software problem with check-in counters coupled with bad weather meant hours of delays and several flight cancellations over the weekend at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport. The cause of the software issue, which was cleared up early Sunday morning, was not given by the airport's spokesperson.

Stock Market IT Reliability Not Trending Upward

Stock traders had hoped that 2014 would bring fewer of the exchange and other stock-related “glitches” that plagued them throughout 2013. Alas, last week saw fresh problems reported with the NASDAQ Options Market, as well as online brokerage firm E*Trade. While the former lasted for less than 30 minutes, the E*Trade outage lasted for nearly 5 hours. The causes of both outages are reportedly still under investigation.

Finally, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) website and supporting systems continues to make news. According to the Washington Post, the ACA website development and support contract for prime contractor CGI will not be renewed. Instead, the maintenance contract will be given to Accenture under a sole-source contract. CGI insists it was not fired; let's just say it wasn't rehired due to the underwhelming quality of its work.

2014-02-01T07:00:00Z,Oregon Health Insurance Exchange Still Inoperable," $220 Million spent, no one signed up yet ",,,,,,,2.2E8,$,USD,US,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/uncover-oregon-states-healthcare-exchange-website-still-inoperable-four-months-after-planned-launch,,(Un)Cover Oregon: State’s Healthcare Exchange Website Still Inoperable Four Months After Planned Launch,"Last week was a rather slow week with regard to the number of reported IT errors, miscalculations, and problems. So we decided to start off this week’s IT Hiccups edition with a status check of some state Affordable Care Act (ACA) website implementations.

While most of the major snafus that plagued the operations of the U.S. government’s ACA website have been taken care of (making changes to policies still seems an issue, however), IT issues associated with several states’ implementation of the ACA continue. A nice summary accompanied by myriad news links to the difficulties in four states—Oregon, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Maryland—was provided in a ProPublica article published last week.

Oregon’s healthcare exchange, Cover Oregon, is having the worst time of it. Four months after its originally planned launch date of 1 October 2013, the $220 million site still hasn’t signed up one person for healthcare insurance. Some 35 000 Oregonians have been enrolled in Cover Oregon via paper applications; the state has had to hire 400 workers, at a cost of $4 million, to process those applications. It is still unclear, however, when (or if) the Cover Oregon’s website will get up and running.

In Minnesota, $160 million has been spent on MNSure, which is only just sputtering along. Problems there include informing applicants that, according to the Caledonia Argus, “they’re eligible for the wrong tax credit or no credit at all, even if your income entitles you to it."" There is also major under-staffing at the call center set up to answer applicant questions. An outside appraisal of MNsure says that the exchange website's problems are so great, that it could take up to two more years before they are fixed. The state had projected that 135 000 people would have used MNSure to enroll in healthcare insurance plans by now, but so far only about 28 000 Minnesotans have done so.

Last week, Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced that an insurance executive had been hired to oversee the state's bungled healthcare exchange website. According to the Wall Street Journal, the reason, Patrick said, was that, “The website is still too cumbersome, and as more people need to update their coverage in the coming weeks, there is no assurance that the current system can handle the new and higher traffic… Bottom line: The website that was supposed to make it easy has not worked well enough.” The governor also said that another $10 million has been added to the $68 million originally budgeted for the website. So far, Massachusetts has paid the prime contractor, CGI, only $15 million for its botched work, and the $10 million is going to another contractor, Optum, in hope of finally and quickly correcting the website’s problems.

I’ve noted previously noted some of Maryland's problems, such as its healthcare exchange website incorrectly listing the Seattle Pottery Supply company’s telephone number as the one that individuals seeking help in signing up for health insurance should call. While that issue has been resolved, last week it was reported that a Pennsylvania woman’s Gmail address was listed by the exchange as that of an official navigator who could also help Marylanders with signing up for healthcare. She is not amused by the mistake, to say the least. There were also stories such as one in the Washington Post last week regarding the lawsuit between two of the main contractors working on Maryland’s exchange; each sought to deflect blame onto the other for the website's persistent problems.

One common theme in each of the states, ProPublica reported, is how none of the government officials in charge seemed to know that their respective state exchanges were in such bad shape, despite numerous risk assessments, some going back years, telling them that the sites were disasters in the making. One can only conclude that the officials are either liars, fools or more likely, both.

New Zealand Payroll Problem Refuses to Die

In August 2012, New Zealand launched a new NZD $182 million payroll system for 110 000 teachers and support staff. Since then, the system has been nothing but trouble, with thousands of teachers not getting paid, or being paid too much or too little. It is estimated that teachers and staff at 90 percent of New Zealand’s 2400-plus schools have experienced problems with their pay.

The New Zealand government spent most of 2013 (and another $20 million) trying to sort the problems out. At various times, officials declared that the end was in sight, only to have more pay problems crop up. The latest declaration that things would soon be fixed once and for all was in mid-January—with government and education officials expressing to the Otago Daily Times “confidence in the beleaguered payroll system … for the first time since it was rolled out.”

However, last week, more teacher and staff pay problems were being reported, with some staff again going unpaid. How many teachers and staff are affected is not yet known, but they are getting that sickening feeling of déjà vu all over again.

Air India Boeing 787 Suffers Software Fault Leading to Emergency Landing

We close out with the story of an Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner on its way from Melbourne, Australia, to New Delhi. It had to make an emergency landing in Kuala Lumpur due to a “software glitch” that affected the aircraft's flight management computers.

The New York Times quotes Praveen Bhatnagar, an Air India spokesman, as saying, “There was an indication in the flight management computers that there was a software glitch, so the pilot decided to land at the nearest airport, which was Kuala Lumpur… Once you have lost confidence in the machine and on the software, then you cannot take the risk, so the pilot took the controls in his own hands and landed the plane safely.”

Boeing issued a statement saying, “We are aware of the in-service incident and working with Air India to provide support.”

Air India indicated that something similar happened to another Boeing 787, but that it did not know what airline was supposedly affected.

Coincidentally, Polish airline LOT canceled a Boeing 787 flight last week, also because of a computer malfunction.

The board overseeing the exchange voted Sunday night to sever ties with Noridian Healthcare Solutions, and the state reserves the right to take the company to court for damages, officials said Monday.

Maryland has terminated its contracts with the company hired to build and operate the state’s online health exchange, which has been riddled with problems since its launch in October.

Critics of the botched rollout said Noridian should have been replaced long before now, and they renewed calls for an investigation into why Maryland stumbled with implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The website is so flawed that state officials are considering abandoning it after open enrollment ends next month.

The decision ends a $193 million deal for North Dakota-based Noridian to build and host the online insurance marketplace for the next five years. For now, the state will rely on Optum/QSSI, a Columbia-based company hired in December to help fix Maryland’s exchange.

Officials said the move would help more people sign up for health insurance before the March 31 deadline.

“By moving now, we improve the quality of work,” said Isabel FitzGerald, secretary of the state’s Department of Information Technology who stepped in to help fix the exchange.

FitzGerald said she recommended the nine-member Maryland Health Benefit Exchange Board cut ties with Noridian after it missed a series of goals to fix the website.

Noridian officials said in a statement the company is “negotiating a mutual agreement regarding the transition of Noridian’s role as prime contractor” with the state and will continue to offer technical support until the end of March.

“Throughout the past four months, Noridian has complied with its contractual obligations under tremendous pressure and constant changes by the state,” said Tom McGraw, Noridian’s president and CEO, in the statement.

The state Senate’s Republican leader likened the site’s continuing problems to “an iceberg.”

“The further down they go, the more and more problems they discover,” said Senate Minority Leader David R. Brinkley, who serves on the legislative panel overseeing repairs to the exchange.

U.S. Rep. John Delaney, a Democrat who has been critical of the implementation of Obamacare in Maryland, said “the real question is why it took months to make this move.”

Noridian oversaw development of the website, which crashed the day it went live and has technical problems that persist. Only five weeks remain for people without health insurance to buy it or face a tax penalty, and state officials said that Optum can better repair the site to handle a rush of last-minute buyers.

“The progress was simply not satisfactory,” FitzGerald said in an interview, adding that Optum has “got a deep bench” of experts to help.

At a hearing Monday before the General Assembly's joint oversight committee on the exchange, FitzGerald said there are “major architectural” problems with the exchange, aside from the 1,538 “defects” that have been discovered since the exchange went live. So far, 1,072 have been resolved, she said.

Most of the repairs have been done by subcontractors hired by Noridian; those companies will now report to Optum instead, FitzGerald said.

Noridian is embroiled in a legal fight with another exchange contractor, EngagePoint, over who bears responsibility for the flawed website.

The switch from Noridian “gives the exchange the best chance of being fairly productive,” said Dr. Peter Beilenson, CEO of Evergreen Health Co-op, which sells policies through the exchange.

The technical problems have left the state far behind its goal to sign up 260,000 people for insurance, either through private policies or through Medicaid. Health Secretary Dr. Joshua M. Sharfstein said Monday the state would retain that goal, even though it recently learned it was mistakenly based on a projection for two years, not one.

The state also has abandoned work on another piece of implementing the Affordable Care Act: a health exchange for small businesses. Noridian’s contract included the small-business exchange.

As of Feb. 10, the state had paid Noridian $65 million, roughly a third of the long-term contract negotiated with the company. Noridian has billed the state $78 million.

Sharfstein also told the legislative panel reviewing the exchange that within weeks, officials will decide whether to keep trying to fix it or try to put something else in place before the next open enrollment period begins in November. Options include adopting all or part of a website made by one of the 14 other states that built their own exchanges or relying on the federal system.

Optum helped repair the federal site last fall when it also encountered technical problems that thwarted people’s ability to sign up for health care coverage. Maryland has signed a $14 million deal with Optum, although Sharfstein told lawmakers it is unclear whether the state will end up paying more or less than if it stayed with Noridian.

Already, the state has budgeted more than $260 million — much of it federal money — to build the health care exchange. This year, problems with the launch will cost the state at least $33 million more than officials originally planned to spend.

The joint oversight committee voted to ask legislative auditors to do a “performance review” of the exchange, an inquiry that would not be complete until July 2015. Auditors were already scheduled to begin a more narrow inquiry into the finances of the exchange this summer.

Senate Republicans, who have been calling for an immediate investigation by a committee with subpoena powers, sent a letter to Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler on Monday asking his office to probe now what went wrong with the exchange.

In his campaign for governor, Gansler has used the troubled exchange as ground to question the leadership of his chief rival for the Democratic nomination, Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, who was the administration’s point person on implementing the health reform.

In the letter, the Republicans said they wrote Gansler “out of a shared concern that those in power in Annapolis will never truly conduct a full and impartial investigation into the botched implementation of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange and the disastrous rollout of the occupying website.” The letter concluded by asking Gansler if he “had the resolve” to pursue such an inquiry.

Through a spokesman, Gansler said his office received the letter and was reviewing it.

Brown said in a statement that severing ties with Noridian was “one of many steps that we've taken to improve accountability and build a better performing, more effective exchange for Marylanders.”

A spokeswoman for Gov. Martin O’Malley said he also supported ending the contract with Noridian.

However, as we have the past few weeks, we again begin this week’s IT Hiccups edition with an auto-related IT issue.

According to the Washington Post, 989 701 Nissan and Infiniti 2013 and 2014 model year vehicles are being recalled to fix a problem in the software that controls air bag deployment for the front seat passenger. They include: 544 000 Altima sedans; 29 000 Leaf electric vehicles; 124 000 Pathfinder SUVs; 183 000 Sentra compact cars; 6700 NV2000 taxis; and 104 000 Infiniti JX35, Q50 and QX60 vehicles.

The Post states that, “Unfortunately, the software installed on the vehicles…may incorrectly determine that the passenger seat is empty when it is, in fact, occupied. If that were to happen, and if the vehicle were subsequently involved in an accident, the passenger‐seat airbags would fail to deploy, increasing the possibility of injury or death.”

A New York Times article says that, “The automaker blamed the sensitivity of the software calibration, particularly when ‘a combination of factors such as high engine vibration at idle when the seat is initially empty and then becomes occupied’ or an ‘unusual’ seating posture are factors.”

Nissan indicates that it was aware of three such accidents, although no fatalities were reported, as a result of the collisions where airbags failed to activate. The company is working on a patch for the software, which should be available in the next few weeks.

In another software-related automobile recall, General Motors is recalling 656 of its 2014 Cadillac ELR vehicles in order to recalibrate software in the electronic control brake module that is part of its electronic stability control system. GM also announced last week that it was recalling another 824 000 vehicles for issues with defective ignition switches I discussed a few weeks ago. It also announced recalls of another 662 000 other vehicles for various other mechanical issues. GM has now recalled over 4.8 million vehicles since the beginning of year. This week GM and the National Highway Transport Safety Administration will face Congressional hearings on their roles in regard to the delayed ignition switch recall.

Iowa Mayor Unhappy About Disclosure of Crime Reporting Software Problem

Matt Walsh, the mayor of Council Bluffs, Iowa, is reportedly very unhappy that the state government was told by a local county board member that the new software system the local police use to record crime statistics was flawed. According to a World‐Herald News Service article, the Council Bluffs police department began using software last year provided by the Iowa Department of Transportation to enter local crime statistics. However, a software programming error “upgraded” many of the crimes entered. For instance, a simple assault reported by the police instead got changed by the software into a more serious aggravated assault.

The problem with the new software helped explain why Council Bluffs was recently listed as No. 56 on the most 100 most dangerous places to live in the U.S., the World-Herald said. Now, one would think the city’s mayor would be happy about the flaw being discovered and his city’s reputation as a criminal haven being rehabilitated. Yet, the Des Moines Register states that Mayor Welsh was incensed. Why? Well, the state provides crime enforcement grant funding to the city based on crime statistics, and the mayor is now worried the city may have to return some of the state grant money it received.

The Register quotes the mayor as saying, “What kind of individual runs to the state and tattles? …This money is to fight crime.” The mayor also claims that since the police department originally reported its crimes correctly, it isn’t the city’s fault that the software system provided by the state screwed up, so the money it previously received from the state is rightfully the city’s.

Hmm… maybe the teenager who found $31 000 mistakenly deposited in his account by the First Citizens Bank in Hull, Georgia a few weeks ago and who decided to spend it should have used the same ethical reasoning, instead of lying and pretending that the money was deposited on purpose as part his share of an inheritance from his grandmother’s estate.

Maryland Throws in the Towel on its Affordable Care Act Website

Today is the last day to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (with some exceptions) until the next open enrollment season. To say the least, the introduction of the ACA on 1 October 2013 has been interesting to watch from an IT system risk mismanagement perspective, both at the federal and state level. Even now, the federal site still is reporting access issues.

However, five states— Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Vermont— have given star performances in how not to create a state ACA website and supporting infrastructure systems. An Associated Press article provides a decent overview of the health insurance exchange implementation problems encountered in each state, as does another story at VTDigger.org that examines the issues confronting the Massachusetts and Vermont exchanges in greater depth.

However, for sheer incompetence, Maryland’s ACA implementation debacle really stands out (although Oregon's comes in a close second). After spending at least $125.5 million, Maryland has decided to basically abandon its exchange, the Washington Post reported. The state reportedly will be using the exchange system Connecticut has developed and is eager to sell to other states, which seems to work better than most.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched an investigation into what went wrong with the Maryland's health insurance exchange. However, it is unlikely that any results will be published before the state primary elections in June. The reason is that Democratic Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who once proudly proclaimed that he was in charge of the Maryland ACA implementation, is running for governor, and I doubt the federal government wants to be seen as possibly interfering with the election. To say that Brown was asleep at the health exchange switch would be to assume, given his role in the unfolding debacle and his very recent claims that the exchange implementation is a “success,” that he knew where the switch was in the first place.

for the IT project, although its intended functions have been incorporated into a new, broader project to secure the UK's borders.

Charles Montgomery, director general of the UK’s Border Force, told a meeting of the Home Affairs Select Committee on Tuesday 11 March 2014 that e-Borders had been ""terminated"".

But Home Office officials were subsequently keen to point out that although the e-Borders name is no longer used, all the intended aims of the programme have been merged into the the Border System Programme (BSP), an initiative launched in January 2013. At the time BSP was put out to tender, the Home Office told Computer Weekly it was separate to e-Borders, but its scope has since been expanded.

The e-Borders programme was first commissioned in 2003 to improve the use of data to track people moving in and out of the UK’s borders. One aim was to conduct checks on travellers at the point of embarkation to the UK, rather than on arrival in the country.

A pilot project called Semaphore was delivered by IBM in 2004, and was due to be replaced by the Raytheon-led Trusted Borders consortium. But that deal was cancelled in July 2010, due to continued delays in delivery of key milestones. Raytheon is suing the government over the cancellation of the contract.

A report into e-Borders last year by John Vine, the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration, suggested a new supplier was to be chosen by the end of the year, but no public announcements have been made.

As a result, e-Borders is still using two systems – Semaphore and Warnings Index – known to contain “critical system vulnerabilities”, according to Vine’s report. The Warnings Index database itself is understood to be about 15 years’ old, and its supplier, Fujitsu, has been in discussions with the government over its future.

Montgomery told MPs: “The e-Borders programme has been terminated.""

Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP expressed surprise at the news and questioned past commitments to deliver the functions intended for e-Borders before the 2015 general election.

But Montgomery said: “We are in the business of replacing Warnings Index and Semaphore, and I am confident we are well on track to delivering that, but not the full e-Borders capability as it was by the general election.”

The Home Office subsequently said that it wrote to Vaz last year explaining the changes.

Vaz, meanwhile, said to the BBC: ""This debacle has cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds, taken more than a decade and yet we still do not know if the original objectives will ever be achieved.

""Promises have been made that exit checks will be in place by the general election, but given past failures the government need to urgently clarify the timetable for the completion of the rest of the programme, what components of the original e-Borders programme have been dropped and when arbitration proceedings with Raytheon will finally conclude.""

The Border Force chief also told MPs that there was still no resolution to the discussions between the government and Raytheon over the cancelled e-Borders contract.

“Arbitration is being scrutinised independently. The Home Office is as anxious as anybody else for the outcome of that, but it is not within Home Office’s gift to determine timelines,” said Montgomery.

According to the Border System Procurement tender issued last year, the Border Force is seeking support and maintenance for existing security systems, along with their convergence and rationalisation; and the delivery of new capabilities – such as the provision of mobile devices – which will include biometric capabilities.

Home Office officials said that BSP will now provide everything that e-Borders intended to, ""and more"".
The Home Secretary has today written to the Home Affairs Select Committee to inform Parliament that an award has been made in the binding arbitration with Raytheon Systems Ltd over the e-Borders programme.

Instead the Tribunal looks at the way the contract had been managed by the UK Border Agency and finds the processes used in reaching a decision and carrying out the termination were flawed.

The Tribunal’s ruling does not pass any judgement on whether Raytheon had defaulted on the contract nor whether the Home Office was therefore justified in terminating it.

The arbitration over the termination of Raytheon Systems Ltd’s contract to deliver e-Borders has now concluded.

£9,600,851 for disputed contract change notices (this relates to contract changes where the parties could not, during the contract, agree the value).

As part of the arbitration process, the Home Office and Raytheon asked the Tribunal to agree the amount to be paid to Raytheon for the assets acquired through the contract between 2007 and 2010, which the Tribunal assessed as £126,013,801.

The Tribunal awarded interest on those sums (and letters of credit) at rates which will lead to a total cost of approximately £38 million.

The Treasury will work with the Home Office to make sure these costs are met without any impact on frontline services. We are looking carefully at the Tribunal’s detailed conclusions to see if there are any grounds for challenging the Award.

The Government stands by the decision to end the e-Borders contract with Raytheon. This decision was, and remains, the most appropriate action to address the well-documented issues with the delivery and management of the programme.

The contract, signed in 2007 and worth around £750 million in total, was terminated by the Government in 2010, at which point it had cost the taxpayer £259.3 million including £195 million in supplier costs.

Key milestones had been missed and parts of the programme were running at least a year late. Raytheon Systems Ltd had been in breach of contract since 2009. Prolonged negotiations had taken place under the previous Government which had led nowhere.

The situation the Government inherited was therefore a mess with no attractive options.

All other alternatives available to the Government would have led to greater costs than the result of this Tribunal ruling. Continuing with the contract and trying to rectify the deep rooted problems was estimated at the time as likely to cost £97 million more than terminating it, even with today’s settlement.

The Major Projects Review Group, a cross-government group run jointly by the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury, considered the Raytheon contract in July 2010. It established an expert panel of seven senior members, drawn from inside and outside government. The panel recommended that the contract should be terminated for cause immediately and the project re-scoped significantly.

After careful consideration of all the available advice, and discussions with senior officials, HMT and MPRG, I made a final decision to terminate the contract on the basis that Raytheon had not been compliant with its contractual obligations, and I no longer had confidence in Raytheon to deliver it.

While the Tribunal has not found against the decision to terminate the contract, it has raised concerns about how the Raytheon contract was managed by the UK Border Agency and the processes involved in deciding to terminate and how it was carried out.

The Permanent Secretary of the Home Office, Mark Sedwill, has therefore asked the National Audit Office to conduct a full review of e-Borders from its inception. I appreciate that both your own Home Affairs Committee and the Public Accounts Committee may wish to look into the UK Border Agency’s handling of e-Borders and the Raytheon contract.

In addition, given the findings of the Tribunal, I have asked the Permanent Secretary to conduct a review of the advice provided to Ministers and the manner in which the UK Border Agency managed the process of terminating the contract.

The Government has already taken steps to make sure this kind of thing should not happen again.

I have been very clear about how the UK Border Agency had been a troubled organisation, with performance that was not good enough. In March 2012, the Government created Border Force – to have a clear law enforcement focus and to re-establish border security as an urgent priority. And in March 2013 I abolished the remainder of the UK Border Agency, creating two, very distinct Directorates General – UK Visas and Immigration and Immigration Enforcement – giving them each a clear focus and bringing them under much closer Ministerial supervision.

Since the Raytheon contract was signed, the Government has improved its approach to procurement and would never enter into such a contract today. Since 2010 the Government has adopted a policy of disaggregating larger, longer-term contracts worth more than £100m. This means the risk of failure by a private sector contractor is pooled and the taxpayer is protected.

Shortening the contract terms and limiting scope is ideal for IT contracts where the requirements and environment are subject to change. Smaller contracts are easier to define, manage performance and deliver to schedule. There is also greater resilience to contractual or supplier failure.

The original e-Borders requirement – to record Advanced Passenger Information for checking against terrorist and crime watchlists – is being delivered. The estimated proportion of passengers who travel to and from the UK, for whom we collect Advance Passenger Information on routes connected to Semaphore, is currently just over 80% – up considerably from just over 60% at the end of 2009. This is the highest for any European country according to the European Commission, and is amongst the best in the world.

Advance Passenger Information is a priority for border control and security, and already covers 95% of commercial air routes with the UK. The Home Office continues to drive that up, strengthening coverage in the maritime and rail sectors alongside air routes, including through new powers in the Immigration Act this year.

The Permanent Secretary at the Home Office is sending a copy of this letter, in parallel, to Rt Hon Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts.","UK,Project Failure,Government,National,Customs,,£,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,airport/port/customs/systems"
2014-03-01T07:00:00Z,Software Testing Problems Continue To Plague F-35," Delays in software delivery, limited capability in the software when delivered, and the need to fix problems and retest multiple software versions ",,,,,,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/aerospace/aviation/software-testing-problems-continue-to-plague-f35-joint-strike-fighter-program,true,Software Testing Problems Continue to Plague F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program,"The U.S. General Accountability Office (GAO) earlier this week released its fifth annual report on the state of the F-35 Lightning II, aka the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), aka the “most costly and ambitious” acquisition program ever. What the GAO found was foretold by a report earlier this year by the Department of Defense’s Director of Operational Test and Evaluation. The upshot: the F-35 operational and support software development continues to be the major obstacle to the program's success.

In addition, the GAO report states that the projected cost of acquiring the planned 2443 F-35 aircraft (which comes in three flavors) threatens to consume some 20- to 25 percent of annual defense program acquisition funds for the next twenty years or so. The GAO doesn’t explicitly say so, but the operations and maintenance costs of the program—currently estimated to be between $800 billion and $1 trillion dollars or more over the next 50 years—will also consume a significant chunk of DoD’s annual weapon-system related O&M budget as well.

The GAO report states that, “Challenges in development and testing of mission systems software continued through 2013, due largely to delays in software delivery, limited capability in the software when delivered, and the need to fix problems and retest multiple software versions.” Further, the GAO notes that the F-35 program continues to “encounter slower than expected progress in developing the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS),” which is the F-35’s advanced integrated maintenance and support system (pdf). In the latter case, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the F-35 Program Executive Officer, conceded last month that the ALIS system was “way behind” where it should be and was “in catch-up mode.” This, the GAO indicates, was apparently at least partly because of a lack of testing facilities that remains a problem years after ALIS development began.

The GAO notes that as a result of the on-going software problems with the aircraft's mission and support systems, F-35 program officials and contractors alike believe that software development will continue to be the F-35 program’s “most significant risk area.”

Software-testing related issues involving the development and fielding mission systems were the main thrust of this year’s GAO report. The F-35, you may recall, is delivering its mission capabilities in a series of incremental “software blocks,” designated as Block 1A/B, Block 2A, Block 2B, Block 3i, and Block 3F. Each block builds on the mission capability developed in the preceding block. As described by the report, “Blocks 1 and 2A provide training capabilities and are essentially complete, with some final development and testing still underway. Blocks 2B and 3i provide initial warfighting capabilities and are needed by the Marine Corps and Air Force, respectively, to achieve initial operational capability. Block 3F is expected to provide the full suite of warfighting capabilities, and is the block the Navy expects to have to achieve its initial operational capability.” According to Flightglobal, a software Block 4 is being planned as an eventual mission capability upgrade for which development will begin late this year or more likely early next.

However, the GAO report states that, “Developmental testing of Block 2B software is behind schedule and will likely delay the delivery of expected warfighting capabilities,” required by the Marines for their variant of the F-35 (the F-35B) that is scheduled for delivery by July 2015. As of January of this year, “the program planned to have verified the functionality of 27 percent of the software’s capability on-board the aircraft, but had only been able to verify 13 percent,” says the GAO report. In more than a bit of an understatement, the GAO says that, “This leaves a significant amount of work to be done before October 2014, which is when the program expects to complete developmental flight testing of this software block.”

The GAO notes—and seems to agree with—the Operational Test and Evaluation Director's view that a more realistic estimate for when Block 2B’s software functional verification will be completed is sometime closer to November 2015. The report also notes that such a delay would create a knock-on effect to the subsequent F-35 software blocks as well, increasing the cost of the acquisition, not to mention delaying the planned initial operational capability (IOC) of the aircraft (2016 for the Air Force F-35As, and 2018 for the Navy F-35Cs).

Yet, despite everything it saw, the GAO indicates that the F-35 program office and contractors, and especially the Marines, seem to be all whistling along to Bobby McFerrin’s song, “Don’t Worry, Be Happy.” The GAO states that, “Program and contractor officials have stated that while they recognize that the program faces software risks, they still expect to deliver all of the planned F-35 software capabilities to the military services as currently scheduled.” Why do they think so? Why, they are now going to introduce new approaches to gain “testing efficiency.” The plan: mainly by using “test results from one F-35 variant to close out test points for the other two variants in instances in which the variants have common functions.” However, Bloomberg News quoted a recent RAND assessment of the F-35 program as stating that, “As of this writing, it is not clear how common the mission systems, avionics, software and engine will be among the three service variants,” so how much efficiency will in reality be gained remains to be seen.

In fact, in testimony before Congress yesterday, Lt. Gen Bogdan was reported by Reuters as saying he was “pretty confident” that Block 2B software would be delivered within 30 days of its current target date to allow the Marines to get to initial operational capability by July next year, as the software is “80 percent complete.” However, Bogdan also indicated that he was not as confident that even ten Marine F-35Bs would be IOC ready given that most of the 40-plus Marine F-35Bs will require some 96 engineering modifications by then.

Lt. Gen. Bogdan also disclosed at the hearing that “Block 3F [software] is dependent upon the timely release of Block 2B and 3I, and at present, 3F is tracking approximately four to six months late without taking steps to mitigate that delay.”

One does hope the program’s Block 2B software testing efficiency strategy is successful, since the GAO indicates the F-35 is scheduled to undergo operational testing in June of next year, “to determine that the aircraft variants can effectively perform their intended missions in a realistic threat environment.” If the new testing strategy is not successful, the GAO's view is that the cost of the F-35 acquisition and its future sustainment costs will just keep on escalating.

In response to the GAO report, the F-35 program office has agreed to deliver to Congress an assessment of the “risks of delivering required capabilities within the stated initial operational capability windows for each military service.” The GAO wants that assessment completed and the risks reported by July 2015, but the program hasn’t committed itself to any specific timetable to deliver a detailed assessment. As a Marine Corps Times article seems to suggest, future disclosures on the part of the program office concerning the risks of possible program schedule slips or cost increases will more than likely happen only in piecemeal fashion and by accident.

Of course, even if the F-35 Block 2B software is late—or one or more of the other software blocks are delayed for that matter—it really presages very little change in the general future direction of the program. Why? Well, in a CBS News 60 Minutes interview in February, Lt. Gen. Bogdan was asked, “Has the F-35 program passed the point of no return?” to which he replied, “I don't see any scenario where we're walking back away from this program.”

The GAO is officially scheduled to conduct one more annual review of the F-35 acquisition. The only purpose of it that I can see is merely to warn current and future U.S. taxpayers, many who are not yet born, how much more money they will have to shell out for the next 50 years or more.

2014-03-01T07:00:00Z,Oregon Terminates Health Insurance Exchange Contract , Over $248 Million spent without anything to show for it ,,,,,,,2.48E8,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/oracle-assails-states-false-narrative-of-blame-over-cover-oregon-debacle,,Oracle Assails State’s “False Narrative” Explaining Cover Oregon Debacle,"Last week was a very, very quiet week with only a few IT-related errors, malfunctions or problems being reported. So, for this week’s edition of IT Hiccups, we decided to revisit the ongoing and increasingly nasty public dispute surrounding Oregon’s health insurance exchange. Things took an interesting turn last week, courtesy of Oracle’s irate letter telling state government officials to quit lying about the company's role in the debacle.

As I wrote recently, Oregon’s attempt to implement its own health insurance exchange, called Cover Oregon, by 1 October 2013 to support the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has not been exactly stellar. The state, after spending $200 million, is still trying to decide whether it will fix its website (no member of the public has ever directly enrolled for state health insurance coverage using it), use another state’s exchange software (like Maryland has decided to do), or default to using the Federal exchange. As I noted last week, news reports state that the number of “most serious programming bugs” discovered in Oregon's healthcare website implementation has reportedly grown from 13 in January to over 300 currently. State officials are supposed to decide any day now which alternative is most appealing.

Oregon state officials have not been shy about blaming its major software supplier, Oracle, for its problems. As a story at MSN last November documented, in a state hearing into the causes behind the Cover Oregon’s woes, Cover Oregon board member Ken Allen said:

“This is their [Oracle’s] failure. . . Their dates have shifted and shifted and shifted. . . The Cover Oregon staff are tremendously dedicated folks who have worked really hard. . . All of that good will and support from the business community is being frittered away because Oracle didn’t get it online. It’s 98% Oracle’s screw up.”

Democratic Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley also pointed the finger in November at Oracle on NBC’s Nightly News television program, saying that:

“Oracle was contracted to write the exchange. They promised it would be fully delivered on time, it would be beautiful and do more than any other exchange in the country, and it's in complete dysfunction.”

Merkley has continued placing the blame on Oracle in subsequent public appearances, as did Cover Oregon’s previous CIO Aaron Karjala, and Governor John Kitzhaber, who also claimed he was in the dark about how bad the problems really were. Kitzhaber did concede that the state may have been a bit at fault, but only in terms of having had an “unrealistically high sense of optimism that Oracle could deliver.”

Early in March, Oregon and Oracle reached an agreement to basically end the contract. The new deal calls for the state to pay Oracle $43.9 million of the $69.5 million the company claimed it was owed for its Cover Oregon work from November last year through February of 2014. Oracle had already been paid some $90 million for its previous project efforts. According to the agreement, at the end of sixty days, both sides could seek legal recourse to recover monies each thought due it.

The rapidly approaching end of the sixty-day period and the recent appointment of a new Cover Oregon executive director, Clyde Hamstreet, may well explain why Oracle President and Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz decided to end the company's silence about what it believed went wrong. Last week, Catz sent what can only be termed a provocative letter (pdf) to Hamstreet demanding the state to quit spreading a “false narrative” that seeks to blame the company for everything wrong with Cover Oregon.

Catz says in her letter that “contrary” to what Oregon officials have been telling the press, Oracle was never the lead in charge of the Oregon Health Exchange effort. In fact, Oregon “by choice and by contract, were squarely in charge of the project,” she writes. And in spite of repeatedly being told by outside experts to hire a system integrator and promises that it would do so, Catz said, Oregon declined to hire one.

Oracle’s only role was to “assist” the state with various tasks, Catz states. In addition, Oracle “provided clear and repeated warnings” for months that the effort was in trouble. A person “with even minimal IT expertise would have known that the system would not, and could not, go live on October 1.” Furthermore, some “critical specifications” were not given to Oracle until November 2013.

Catz goes on to say that the Cover Oregon system is actually working and has been for several weeks, despite the state saying it is not. System availability now usually is “exceeding 99%” and “the current error rate has dropped to 0.7%.” Catz says individuals could indeed sign up using the Cover Oregon website, but for some unexplained reason, the state refuses to let that happen.

Catz finishes her letter with a parting shot telling the state to do itself a favor and hire a systems integrator, as it promised it would do “at the beginning of the project.”

Cover Oregon’s Hamstreet wrote back (pdf) to Catz saying he was still getting up to speed, and couldn’t yet comment directly on the “factual assertions” contained in her letter. However, he was forwarding her letter to Cover Oregon’s lawyers.

Hamstreet apparently has a great deal of experience in troubled projects, which might be one reason Catz decided to write to him as soon as he was hired. He probably knows that rarely is one party fully to blame for an IT debacle. In addition, Catz probably wanted to try to encourage Hamstreet to look deeper into the history of Cover Oregon, as well as put the state on warning that if a lawsuit ensues, Oracle will be looking to embarrass Cover Oregon and other state officials as much as possible.

In Oracle’s favor is that even a simple Internet search immediately turns up warnings of deep trouble (pdf) with the project dating back to 2012. Also, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released an independent report (pdf) about Cover Oregon in February of this year that described Oregon’s management of the effort, in not so many words, as abysmally amateurish.

This is not to absolve Oracle in any way, however. The company didn’t seem to have any problems taking the state’s money and running, as it were. If things were really so bad, and Oregon reneged on its promise to hire a systems integrator as Catz claimed, why didn’t Oracle immediately ask to be let out of the contract? In addition, for Catz to claim that Oracle was there to merely “assist” the state is clearly disingenuous. To say that Catz’s letter shows more than a little hubris and hypocrisy is putting it mildly.

It will be interesting to see whether Oregon or Oracle decide to take legal action against the other in the next few weeks. Although it would be fun to watch, my guess is no, since it looks like a real lose-lose situation. Oracle risks more damage to its reputation, as does Gov. Kitzhaber, who is running for reelection.

Amid this contretemps is even more drama: the former CIO for the Oregon Health Authority is contemplating suing Oregon for wrongful discharge and defamation—among other charges—based on what she claims is retribution for refusing to go along with a “cover-up” of the problems with Cover Oregon. Other state officials are probably not anxious to get hauled into court to testify about what they knew and when they knew it.

So after a bit more public sword play among all the parties to leave a perception of really caring about wasting taxpayer monies, I expect this debacle will eventually be buried and forgotten, like so many other government IT projects before it.

“The Commonwealth has decided to part ways with CGI, and we are beginning a negotiate with them about what a careful transition looks like,” Sarah Iselin, a special assistant to Gov. Deval Patrick overseeing fixes to the Health Connector website, said Monday after a meeting with the board of the Health Connector.

Since the health insurance website launched Oct. 1, it has been plagued by glitches that have left individual unable to use the website to enroll in subsidized health insurance plans under the national Affordable Care Act. The state has been managing the problems with a mix of temporary coverage, coverage extensions and labor-intensive manual workarounds.

Iselin said at the meeting that the Health Connector will not entirely scrap the website, but is also unwilling to stay the course with CGI. It is currently looking at either hiring a new vendor and rebuilding key components of the website, or potentially using software created for the federal health insurance marketplace or for another state’s exchange.

Iselin said the state has informed CGI of its decision. “We’ve just begun the process of negotiating what we hope will be collaborative and careful transition,” Iselin said.

Linda Odorisio, a CGI spokeswoman, said in a statement that CGI is prepared to work with the state on a transition. “CGI has worked tirelessly to deliver a health insurance exchange for the residents of Massachusetts,” Odorisio said. “We will work with the Commonwealth to ensure a smooth transition to the next phase of exchange deployment, allowing for the best use of system capabilities already in place.”

Patrick said in February that ending the relationship with CGI would be complicated due to the complexity of the website and CGI's ownership of the computer code. Patrick also previously did not rule out a lawsuit against CGI to recoup some of the losses the state will face as a result of the website problems.

MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, a member of the Health Connector board and a national expert on health care reform, asked at the board meeting whether there “will be fights” over getting computer code and other information from CGI.

Iselin responded that she has spoken with the head of CGI and is just starting negotiations over the transition. She said the state's contract with CGI allows for such negotiations. Iselin pointed out that CGI is undergoing a similar transition with the federal government. The administration of President Barack Obama severed its relationship with CGI after problems with the rollout of the federal health care website.

The state had a $69 million contract with CGI, with payments due as certain benchmarks are met. It has paid just $15 million so far and has not made a payment since the fall.

Iselin said the state is committed to negotiating in good faith to negotiate a transition that does not jeopardize the goal of having a functional Health Insurance Exchange, and it is too early to speculate about payments or other conditions of the transition. “We’re at the very beginning of negotiating a careful transition that advances and protects the project’s best interests,” Iselin said.

Secretary of Finance and Administration Glen Shor said it is not possible to predict the full cost of the project yet, since the Health Connector needs to both negotiate the exit with CGI and determine how it will complete the health insurance exchange going forward. “We are entering into conversations with CGI to structure a careful, thoughtful ramp down of the engagement, and I’m sure as part of that discussion, the state of the existing contract and resolution of it would be part of the conversation,” Shor said.

However, as we have the past few weeks, we again begin this week’s IT Hiccups edition with an auto-related IT issue.

According to the Washington Post, 989 701 Nissan and Infiniti 2013 and 2014 model year vehicles are being recalled to fix a problem in the software that controls air bag deployment for the front seat passenger. They include: 544 000 Altima sedans; 29 000 Leaf electric vehicles; 124 000 Pathfinder SUVs; 183 000 Sentra compact cars; 6700 NV2000 taxis; and 104 000 Infiniti JX35, Q50 and QX60 vehicles.

The Post states that, “Unfortunately, the software installed on the vehicles…may incorrectly determine that the passenger seat is empty when it is, in fact, occupied. If that were to happen, and if the vehicle were subsequently involved in an accident, the passenger‐seat airbags would fail to deploy, increasing the possibility of injury or death.”

A New York Times article says that, “The automaker blamed the sensitivity of the software calibration, particularly when ‘a combination of factors such as high engine vibration at idle when the seat is initially empty and then becomes occupied’ or an ‘unusual’ seating posture are factors.”

Nissan indicates that it was aware of three such accidents, although no fatalities were reported, as a result of the collisions where airbags failed to activate. The company is working on a patch for the software, which should be available in the next few weeks.

In another software-related automobile recall, General Motors is recalling 656 of its 2014 Cadillac ELR vehicles in order to recalibrate software in the electronic control brake module that is part of its electronic stability control system. GM also announced last week that it was recalling another 824 000 vehicles for issues with defective ignition switches I discussed a few weeks ago. It also announced recalls of another 662 000 other vehicles for various other mechanical issues. GM has now recalled over 4.8 million vehicles since the beginning of year. This week GM and the National Highway Transport Safety Administration will face Congressional hearings on their roles in regard to the delayed ignition switch recall.

Iowa Mayor Unhappy About Disclosure of Crime Reporting Software Problem

Matt Walsh, the mayor of Council Bluffs, Iowa, is reportedly very unhappy that the state government was told by a local county board member that the new software system the local police use to record crime statistics was flawed. According to a World‐Herald News Service article, the Council Bluffs police department began using software last year provided by the Iowa Department of Transportation to enter local crime statistics. However, a software programming error “upgraded” many of the crimes entered. For instance, a simple assault reported by the police instead got changed by the software into a more serious aggravated assault.

The problem with the new software helped explain why Council Bluffs was recently listed as No. 56 on the most 100 most dangerous places to live in the U.S., the World-Herald said. Now, one would think the city’s mayor would be happy about the flaw being discovered and his city’s reputation as a criminal haven being rehabilitated. Yet, the Des Moines Register states that Mayor Welsh was incensed. Why? Well, the state provides crime enforcement grant funding to the city based on crime statistics, and the mayor is now worried the city may have to return some of the state grant money it received.

The Register quotes the mayor as saying, “What kind of individual runs to the state and tattles? …This money is to fight crime.” The mayor also claims that since the police department originally reported its crimes correctly, it isn’t the city’s fault that the software system provided by the state screwed up, so the money it previously received from the state is rightfully the city’s.

Hmm… maybe the teenager who found $31 000 mistakenly deposited in his account by the First Citizens Bank in Hull, Georgia a few weeks ago and who decided to spend it should have used the same ethical reasoning, instead of lying and pretending that the money was deposited on purpose as part his share of an inheritance from his grandmother’s estate.

Maryland Throws in the Towel on its Affordable Care Act Website

Today is the last day to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (with some exceptions) until the next open enrollment season. To say the least, the introduction of the ACA on 1 October 2013 has been interesting to watch from an IT system risk mismanagement perspective, both at the federal and state level. Even now, the federal site still is reporting access issues.

However, five states— Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon and Vermont— have given star performances in how not to create a state ACA website and supporting infrastructure systems. An Associated Press article provides a decent overview of the health insurance exchange implementation problems encountered in each state, as does another story at VTDigger.org that examines the issues confronting the Massachusetts and Vermont exchanges in greater depth.

However, for sheer incompetence, Maryland’s ACA implementation debacle really stands out (although Oregon's comes in a close second). After spending at least $125.5 million, Maryland has decided to basically abandon its exchange, the Washington Post reported. The state reportedly will be using the exchange system Connecticut has developed and is eager to sell to other states, which seems to work better than most.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched an investigation into what went wrong with the Maryland's health insurance exchange. However, it is unlikely that any results will be published before the state primary elections in June. The reason is that Democratic Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, who once proudly proclaimed that he was in charge of the Maryland ACA implementation, is running for governor, and I doubt the federal government wants to be seen as possibly interfering with the election. To say that Brown was asleep at the health exchange switch would be to assume, given his role in the unfolding debacle and his very recent claims that the exchange implementation is a “success,” that he knew where the switch was in the first place.

The state government has confirmed the IT experiment known as the Ultranet has officially ceased, ending one of the most controversial projects ever rolled out in public education.

The software was intended to transform the way students learn by providing parents with information about their child's lesson plans, giving teachers a place to collaborate and share their curriculum, and allowing students to set personal goals and get feedback online.

Instead, it was plagued with tender problems, blew out by three times its original budget, and ultimately proved so clunky only 4 per cent of the intended 1.5 million teachers, parents and students decided to use it.

Computer giant NEC has taken over the program, rebadged it under the name of GenED and is giving schools the chance to keep it - provided they pay for it out of their own budgets.

But despite insisting ''many schools have signed on'', the company refused to tell Fairfax Media how many are involved, how much they have to pay, or whether there are plans to sell the software, which could result in the education department recouping some costs, albeit a small proportion of the original price tag.

Education Minister Martin Dixon said his department ''had worked hard to extract whatever value we can for Victorian schools from this failed Labor program'', adding that the project was ''botched from conception to implementation''.

It is not the only technology disaster to cost Victorian taxpayers millions of dollars over the years. The myki ticketing system was more than three years late and $350 million over budget. The HealthSMART program, which was meant to ''revolutionise'' the way hospitals dealt with patients, and the LINK police database were also plagued with problems and cost blowouts of $140 million and $100 million respectively.

And in the education portfolio yet again, a student administration program for TAFEs to keep records of their enrolments and finances came under the spotlight last year after blowing out from $66.9 million to almost

$100 million within four years.

Victorian Principals Association president Gabrielle Leigh described the Ultranet as a ''brave concept'' that some primary schools were happy to try out, ''but in the end it was all too hard and there were so many stumbling blocks''.

''It just didn't work out because of the size of the school system,'' she said. ''The notion of us all being connected together was a grand idea, but [now] that the department is no longer providing it, schools don't really have the money to pay for an extra such as that.''","Australia,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Education,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency"
2014-04-01T07:00:00Z,UK £1.2 Billion Universal Credit Programme Begins Again , Program complete date pushed back to 2017 from 2015; £425m spent on the program so far likely to be written off ,,,,,,,4.25E8,£,GBP,UK,Operational Failure,Government,National,Health and Human Services,,http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/04/universal-credit-anatomy-government-failure,,the anatomy of a government failure,"Universal Credit was supposed to solve all of this country’s welfare problems. And yet, just four years after coming to power, the government’s flagship benefits reform programme is in serious trouble. It’s difficult to say quite how much trouble (which is part of the problem) but we know enough for some people to suggest that the project, at least as we know it, may end up having to be scrapped.

It all started so well. The idea of merging six working-age benefits into one, which was first announced by Iain Duncan Smith at the Conservative party conference in 2010, has enjoyed cross-party support from the start. The logic of trying to simplify the system is undeniable, with claimants currently navigating a maze of more than 30 benefits.

It is widely acknowledged that the existing benefits landscape discourages work on low incomes, as every penny earned is lost through reduced benefits. The system is too complex, expensive and increasingly unaffordable. The need for reform is clear.

From the start, Universal Credit has been something of a personal crusade for the Work and Pensions Secretary, Iain Duncan Smith. After being deposed as Conservative Party leader in 2003, he founded the Centre for Social Justice, the think tank which first proposed the concept of a “universal credit” in a report in 2009. It is said that IDS’s ambition to overhaul the welfare state had its origin in a visit to Easterhouse in Glasgow in 2002, where his missionary zeal was ignited by the deprivation he saw.

When the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed a government in the wake of the 2010 election, Duncan Smith was appointed to run the Department for Work & Pensions (DWP), giving him the opportunity to make his plans for Universal Credit a reality.

Fast forward to the present and the programme is in turmoil. Millions of pounds have been wasted on unworkable IT, the project has been run by different five people since mid-2012, and it is surrounded by a deeply secretive culture. It is the subject of virtually open warfare across Whitehall.

In February, the DWP said that 3,610 people had signed up to receive Universal Credit as of November 2013. The benefit is currently available in just 10 jobcentres in the UK, and only single people claiming for one of the six benefits (Jobseeker’s Allowance) it incorporates are eligible to claim. Had it launched nationally for new claimants in October 2013 as originally planned, hundreds of thousands would have been using the new system.

Where did it all go so wrong?

Some believe that the programme was flawed from the start.

When setting up the policy, the DWP said it would use an “agile” method for development on the programme. This means the software would be built piece by piece, making the project responsive to users' needs and able to change during testing. It would then be released in stages. This technique is supposed to avoid the problem where an entire system is built and released, and then the problems are uncovered.

However, experts say that the project was never truly agile in the first place. This was due to the way contracts with fixed features were set up with major IT suppliers such as IBM, Accenture, Atos and Hewlett-Packard, and the requirements for a “big bang” launch in October 2013 (a deadline which, of course, it missed).

Despite the government’s claim in its July 2010 green paper “21st Century Welfare” that the IT changes necessary for Universal Credit would not “constitute a major IT project”, experts view the programme so far as one of the biggest IT projects undertaken by government for decades. It is billed by the government itself as the most radical change to the welfare system since the 1940s.

The National Audit Office’s September 2013 report was a searing indictment of the programme. The spending watchdog accused the DWP of having a “good news” culture, a lack of transparency, inadequate financial controls on the project and, perhaps most damagingly, a lack of any detailed plan. It is clear that the programme had significant issues right from day one.

In November last year, the Public Accounts Committee added its voice to the growing criticism of Universal Credit, saying that it expects much of the £425m spent on the programme by that point to be written off. The report cast doubt on current timetables, targets and budgets and said that the DWP should offer a range of options for how to proceed on the programme to ministers, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury.

I spoke to Mark Foden, an expert in technology-related change in government who has advised a number of Whitehall departments. He explained that “many of the significant problems we have had with large government IT projects – Universal Credit included – stem from the issue that government has not properly grasped the implications of complexity”.

He continued: “In relatively ordered, well-understood situations – building a tunnel, running a sports event or even setting up a large computer network – it is possible to make big, long-term plans and be reasonably certain of achieving them. We generally do a great job of this kind of thing.

“But Universal Credit not this kind of thing. Where there is complexity, and particularly where outcomes depend on significant change in human behaviour, approaches based on the traditional ‘construction’ mindset work poorly. In these situations it's critical to proceed incrementally. This means, at each step, learning what leads to useful outcomes – in the case of Universal Credit, changes in the behaviour of claimants (and not whether the technology functions) – and then adapting the entire approach to suit. This often leads to doing things that just could not be envisaged at the outset. In traditional programmes with big promises and a fixed end date, it is impossible to work this way.

“The problem is not in plans, people or methods; it’s in mindset. Trying to build things that really need to be grown just won’t work; no matter how you manage them.”

The “reset”

The DWP claims that it has made major strides in dealing with these problems. This took the form of carrying out a “reset”, or implementation review, of Universal Credit, a process which finished at the end of last year, according to Iain Duncan Smith.

Although (as with most aspects of the programme), the details are unclear, the reset involved the complete suspension of the governance board and the appointment of Howard Shiplee, formerly construction director for the London 2012 Olympics, to lead the programme from mid-May 2013.

As part of the reset, the DWP worked closely with the Government Digital Service (GDS), a Cabinet Office unit tasked with transforming government online services. They are most well-known for setting up the government’s unified web portal GOV.UK (which won an award for Design of the Year in April 2013).

A “digital solution” is now being developed for Universal Credit, led by initial work from the GDS. It is unclear what this solution looks like, though we know that it is “still many months away from a system that can handle more than 100 people”, according to DWP permanent secretary Robert Devereux, speaking during a work and pensions select committee session in February. It is understood that the digital solution, once fully developed and live, will replace the existing systems – at what cost, we do not know.

In an article in the Telegraph in September 2013, Shiplee said: “There is no doubt there have been missteps along the way. But we’ve put that right.”

However, in a recent appearance in front of a House of Commons select committee, MPs expressed their lack of confidence that the programme has really been fixed, with chairman Dame Anne Begg MP saying to Iain Duncan Smith: “I am not convinced by your argument that you have sorted it out.”

Earlier in the session, she castigated the minister for not informing the committee about the reset at a session in 2013, despite being aware of it at the time. Another MP accused the department of “smoke and mirrors” and “obfuscation” over the project.

Somewhat surprisingly, as it stands Universal Credit is yet to even be signed off by the Treasury, the process where the Chancellor’s department agrees to future spending on the project once it has seen the department’s business case. The DWP refuses to say when it expects this to take place, hinting at a fraught and complicated relationship between the two departments.

Warfare in Whitehall

While many have been involved with the debacle of Universal Credit, one person has nailed his colours so firmly to the mast that if the project fails, he must surely go down with it. Increasingly, fingers are pointing at Iain Duncan Smith.

The work and pensions secretary has had a number of unedifying appearances in front of select committees in September and December 2013, and most recently in February 2014, where he has seemed to neither fully comprehend what has gone wrong on the programme, or what needs to be done to fix it.

It is understood that there are tensions between Iain Duncan Smith and the Chancellor, George Osborne, who ultimately signs off on all spending on the programme through the Treasury.

Insiders believe Osborne does not rate IDS as an intellectual heavyweight, with journalist Matthew D’Ancona quoting him as having told his allies: “You see Iain giving presentations . . . and realise he’s just not clever enough.”

A minister close to the chancellor was quoted at the end of last year saying: “There are some ministers who improve in office and others, like IDS, who show they are just not up to it.”

Similarly, Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, who has worked closely with Iain Duncan Smith and DWP officials on the programme, has declined to publicly back Universal Credit on a number of occasions.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4 in January, Maude was asked how confident he was that the solution now being put in place for the programme will work. “I hope it will work,” he said. When pushed, he added: “Well no one knows with these things . . . the way we do things is very much now more ‘build something quickly, test it, prove it, test it with users’, and so you can’t have certainty about any of these outcomes.”

It is understood that Iain Duncan Smith himself – or at least his aides – has himself been a source of negative briefings as well as recipient, with attempts made at the end of last year to pin at least some of the blame for the problems with Universal Credit on DWP permanent secretary Robert Devereux.

After weeks of hostile briefings to the media, Sir Jeremy Heywood, the country’s most senior civil servant, intervened directly, expressing his concern over the “concerted political briefing campaign” to the prime minister David Cameron. This perhaps gave rise to Iain Duncan Smith’s statement in November 2013 that he had “every confidence” with the team implementing Universal Credit, “and that team includes Robert Devereux”.

Unsurprisingly, during committee sessions, there is a palpable air of tension between Iain Duncan Smith and his permanent secretary. You even get the impression that they are barely on speaking terms – hardly conducive to closely working together on a project.

Losses

So how much is this all going to cost us? The official DWP line is that, of the £312m spent on Universal Credit so far, £40.1m will be written off, a figure which a spokesperson says ""should be balanced against the overall economic benefit of £35bn that Universal Credit will ultimately bring”. It is unclear precisely how this figure has been calculated or what length of time period it applies to.

In January, news reports said that there were just three DWP staff working on the enhanced digital system, which is due to be used for the national rollout in 2017, with 50 IT staff working on the programme as a whole. How many are working on the programme within the various contractors is not clear.

It is difficult to hazard a guess regarding the current bill of total losses on the programme. The Public Accounts Committee says £425m had been spent as of November last year, the majority of which it expects to be wasted.

The DWP has admitted that beyond the £40m in losses, a further £91m is being “written down” over a five-year period, a plan described by the National Audit Office as a “major change in accounting treatment”.

Senior civil servants pitch the current total losses between £161m to almost the entire amount spent so far (which ranges from £312m to almost £700m depending on who you ask, and Labour says equates to just over £190,000 per claimant). During a Public Accounts Committee session in September, DWP finance director Mike Driver said £161m was his “best assessment” of likely total losses, while the Major Projects Authority director Dr Norma Wood said that much of the £303m invested in IT by that point was “not fit for purpose”.

While potential losses of over £500m are not insignificant, this initial estimate can be compared to the money wasted on the National Programme for IT, an initiative started in 2005 to set up a single electronic care record for NHS patients which would link hospital and GPS data and provide NHS staff with access to patients’ records. This project, seen as the biggest IT disaster of the last two decades, was scrapped in 2011, but not before inflicting an (ongoing) cost of more than £10bn on the taxpayer.

And as ever with Universal Credit, the lack of transparency surrounding the programme means we are unlikely to get an accurate picture of losses for some years.

Will it work?

So will the programme work one day? Tony Collins, an investigative journalist who has written extensively about IT projects, predicts that it will - but not as originally forecast, and it will cost more and take much longer than envisaged.

He says: “From what I know in the context of the reasons for some past IT-related failures, I’d say that Universal Credit is in a worse position than some big programmes because it started, and continued, without senior management having any clear idea how it would work.”

However, Collins remains optimistic. He continues: “I think it’ll follow the path of the previous computerisation of welfare benefits called Operational Strategy.

“It took 10 years and cost three times the expected amount but eventually it worked. It was more disjointed than intended – a variety of separate systems. I think it likely Universal Credit will work but perhaps not much before 2020, and I would not be surprised if it ends up partly face to face rather than fully online because of security.”

Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge is more sceptical. She tells me: “The DWP seems to have embarked on this crucial project, expected to cost the taxpayer some £2.4 billion, with little idea as to how it was actually going to work.

“Confusion and poor management at the highest levels have already resulted in delays and at least £34m wasted on developing IT. If the department doesn’t get its act together, we could be on course for yet another catastrophic government IT failure.”

As it stands, Labour refuses to be drawn into confirming whether or not they will scrap the project if they win the general election next year, saying only that they support the principle of Universal Credit while continuing to criticise the problems with its implementation.

Shadow work and pensions minister Rachel Reeves told me: “What we have seen so far is a huge waste of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money and endless delays to the project.”

She added: “Labour is looking very closely at the detail of Universal Credit including the structure of payments, work incentives, and the detail of how it is rolled out across the country and to different groups of claimants. Once this work is complete we will be in a position to set out further detail.

“Ministers have repeatedly refused to listen to reports that Universal Credit was falling behind schedule, with Iain Duncan Smith insisting time and again that Universal Credit was ‘on time and on budget’. The National Audit Office warned of a ‘good news culture’ within the department, and it’s clear that Iain Duncan Smith and David Cameron need to take personal responsibility for the spiralling waste, huge delays and errors that have plagued Universal Credit. It seems that two parallel IT schemes are now being delivered, with no clear plan for the roll out of Universal Credit.

“Millions of taxpayers’ money has been wasted. And only a handful are now claiming Universal Credit despite ministers promising a million by April 2014. Francis Maude, Tory Minister for the Cabinet Office, was right to say the roll out of Universal Credit was, ‘lamentable’. Ministers need to urgently get a grip of their flagship welfare reform.”

What now?

Regarding the programme’s future, there are a number of possibilities. The general election next May will be an important factor. While expressing support for the idea of Universal Credit, Labour has consistently criticised its implementation, and is yet to say whether or not a Labour government would scrap it.

With over a year to go until the election, the party is probably still making up its mind. However, signs point to a distinct lack of enthusiasm, even more so now that Rachel Reeves is the shadow work and pensions minister. She is believed to be even less enthusiastic about the project than her predecessor Liam Byrne was.

Alternatively, the Conservatives could win a majority, or form another coalition with the Liberal Democrats, which would most likely mean Iain Duncan Smith remaining in post. But even then Universal Credit could become unviable due to its poor implementation.

The DWP says that the new benefit will continue to be rolled out across the country, with expansion to new claims from couples and families in existing jobcentres scheduled for this summer. More coverage in the north-west will follow by the end of this year, they say, with the roll-out gradually increasing in scope and scale over the next two years.

However, given the inaccuracy of past predictions and continuing reluctance to be transparent, it is hard to have much faith in the department’s plans.

One fact remains: despite all the money wasted, the political turmoil, Whitehall infighting, failed IT and departmental chaos described above, the benefit is being claimed by less than 4,000 individuals in the UK.

The remaining 5.4 million people currently claiming working age benefits continue to do so in precisely the same way as they did five years ago.","UK,Operational Failure,Government,National,Health and Human Services,,£,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency"

We start this edition of IT Hiccups with 911 emergency call system outages that hit several states last week.

Early last Thursday morning beginning around 0100 am local time, three counties in Oregon as well as the entirety of Washington State discovered that their emergency 911 call dispatch systems were no longer working. Oregon’s outage was cleared up in about three hours, but it took nearly seven hours before 911 services were restored across Washington State.

At first, the two outages were thought to be related because CenturyLink’s networks were involved in both outages. CenturyLink is a Louisiana-based telecom provider that is contracted with Washington State and the three affected counties in Oregon to provide 911 communication services. In Washington State, the emergency centers are interconnected, so when a network outage occurs it apparently can take them all down at once. There are back-up 911 systems in some localities, but these systems do not provide “enhanced 911” features, such as providing a caller’s address, the Seattle Times reported. In addition, when a caller receives a “fast busy” signal indicating that the 911 system isn’t working or is overloaded, Washington State residents need to remember to call their local emergency services using the regular 10-digit phone codes, state emergency officials said afterwards.

On Friday, a CenturyLink spokesperson said its investigations into the “intermittent interruption,” as the company called the simultaneous 911 outages in Oregon and Washington, were not related by anything other than by what it said was an “uncanny” coincidence. In Oregon, the outage was caused by an issue arising during a scheduled maintenance window, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. OPB quoted CenturyLink spokesperson Martin Flynn as saying that “a computer card was removed from CenturyLink’s master controller, the unit stopped responding and needed to be reset.”

In Washington State, the AP reported that CenturyLink blamed the outage on an unspecified “technical error by a third-party vendor” that was “not related to CenturyLink's network.” A story in the Tacoma News Tribune reported that state emergency officials told the paper that the “outage apparently stemmed from a malfunction in the telephone networks that people use to make everyday calls, not the separate system that sends calls to emergency dispatchers.” CenturyLink apologized for the “inconvenience,” which likely did not satisfy the Everett, Washington woman who could not get through to report an intruder trying to break into her house.

In addition, the Tribune reported that CenturyLink wasn't exactly forthcoming with Washington State emergency management officials on the details of what caused the outage, which has not pleased them, nor the state’s governor who is demanding an explanation of the outage. The state’s Utilities and Transportation Commission has said that it will be investigating the 911 system outage, which should shed more light into its cause.

Washington and Oregon were not alone last week in regards to a 911 system issue. On Wednesday, at least 20 Indiana counties lost 911 services for three and a half hours. The outage was subsequently blamed on a 911 system upgrade by AT&T. A back-up system successfully took over when the outage occurred, although emergency calls took slightly longer to be answered and responded to than normal. AT&T also apologized for the “inconvenience.”

British Columbia Drivers to Get Insurance Refund

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported over the weekend that British Columbia’s government-run insurance company, the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC), has for at least six years both over- and under-charged tens of thousands of B.C. drivers their insurance premiums. Drivers in B.C. must buy their insurance through the ICBC, which is responsible for driver licensing as well as vehicle licensing and registration.

According to the CBC, a computer error under-charged some 60 000 B.C. drivers for their insurance by some $71 million while concurrently over-charging the insurance premiums of another 40 000 B.C. drivers some $36 million. B.C. Transportation Minister Todd Stone, who was described as being “angry” over the error, has ordered ICBC to pay back the over-charged B.C. drivers (including interest) as well as telling the ICBC that it will not be able to recover the premiums it under-charged for.

A story at The Province states that the ICBC blamed the mistake on its on-going migration that began in 2006 from a 40-year old legacy computer system to a new CAD$400 million system which is scheduled to be completed in 2015. The error was discovered last year but it has taken until now to discover the full extent of the error and to develop a repayment plan.

Minister Stone has called for an audit into the error and why it remained undiscovered for so long.

Affordable Care Act Related Errors Still Abound

Well, last week Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius formally announced her resignation. At the announcement, both Sebelius and President Obama claimed victory in turning the ACA website from an error-ridden disaster into one whereby some 7.5 million people successfully have used it to sign-up for health insurance.

Sebelius finally admitted yesterday, however, that she was “flat-out wrong” to think that the ACA website was ready last October 1. She conceded that “more time and testing” would have been useful before rolling it out. Sebelius also tried to deflect the blame for not knowing how bad the situation really was on her inability to ask the right questions, as well as incorrect information coming from her ACA technical advisors. She is quoted by the New York Daily News as saying, “If I had a magic wand and could go back to mid-September and ask different questions based on what I know now, I would. I thought I was getting the best information from the best experts, but clearly that didn't go well.”

Sebelius did not indicate if she had indeed been told at the time that the ACA website wasn’t ready to go whether she would have delayed ACA’s introduction, however. Given the political pressures at the time, I seriously doubt she would have.

ACA-related system issues still remain, however. For instance, computer issues continue to delay the approval of some 800 000 California residents who have applied for Medi-Cal coverage through the ACA. Oregon is still trying to figure out what to do with its still non-functioning website: try to still fix it or default to using the federal ACA website. However, news reports state that the number of the “most serious programming bugs” discovered in Oregon's healthcare website implementation has grown from 13 in January to over 300 currently, which would seem to make the choice fairly obvious. And Massachusetts says it hopes that its glitch-filled website will be finally functioning by November 15th of this year, with the goal of (only) being “minimally compliant” with ACA’s requirements by then. A robust health insurance system would not be available until mostly likely November of 2015, state officials indicated.

2014-05-01T07:00:00Z,U2 Flight Exposes Software Flaw in FAA Air Traffic Control System, Air traffic in four Western States affected by trouble with En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system ,,,1,hours,1,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Transportation,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/report-claims-u2-to-blame-for-us-west-coast-airtraffic-outage,,Report Claims Spy Plane to Blame for Air-Traffic Outage on U.S. West Coast,"Unlike the past month, last week saw an overflowing cornucopia of IT-related malfunctions, errors and complications. We start off this week’s edition of IT Hiccups with a strange story that has followed in the wake of a major air traffic control outage in the U.S.—one of several incidents that aggravated air travelers around the world.

The story starts off simply enough: On Wednesday afternoon, a little after 3:00 p.m. Pacific time, a computer problem occurred with the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) system at the Los Angeles Air Route Control Center. The snafu, a USA Today article reported, left, “controllers temporarily unable to track planes across Southern California and parts of Nevada, Arizona and Utah.” The FAA issued a ground stop on planes wanting to fly to Los Angeles for about an hour until the problem could be cleared up. However, that action caused the cancellation of some 50 flights arriving and departing Los Angeles International Airport and delayed another 455 flights across the country.

ERAM is part of a $2.2 billion Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) modernization effort, which as I have written about previously, has had its problems. So, while the computer problem was a major annoyance, nothing there seemed out of the ordinary. The FAA issued its usual bland statement indicating that it was investigating the issue: “The FAA will fully analyze the event to resolve any underlying issues that contributed to the incident and prevent a recurrence.”

A spokesperson for the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, the union that represents many FAA employees, hinted at the source of problem by telling USA Today that, “There was so much information coming into the system that it overloaded.”

That seemed to be the end of the incident—well, that is until the weekend, when NBC News ran a story online citing “sources familiar with the incident” who claimed that a U-2 spy plane flying in the area triggered the problems with the ERAM computers. (The article's title said the U-2 had ""fried"" the system.) The NBC story reported that:

“The computers at the L.A. Center are programmed to keep commercial airliners and other aircraft from colliding with each other. The U-2 was flying at 60,000 feet, but the computers were attempting to keep it from colliding with planes that were actually miles beneath it.” “Though the exact technical causes are not known, the spy plane’s altitude and route apparently overloaded a computer system called ERAM, which generates display data for air-traffic controllers. Back-up computer systems also failed.”

NBC News contacted the FAA, which basically reissued its previous statement, but also would neither confirm nor deny that the U-2 was the cause of the outage. The U.S. Air Force also declined to comment directly on the story's details, and the Pentagon was not responsive to an inquiry from Reuters. The Wall Street Journal ran a story about the incident today, again, with government officials all deciding to remain mum.

When I saw the U-2 story at the NBC News website, I was more than a bit skeptical, especially over the ""frying"" statement. It is hard to believe that this is the first time military aircraft have passed through the LA ERAM control space at altitudes above normal commercial airline altitudes. On the other hand, I wouldn’t totally discount that there couldn’t have been some unique set of circumstances involving a military aircraft that just happened to be a U-2 triggering an unknown problem within the ERAM software. Still, my instinct is to attribute the problem to a more prosaic explanation. If some official explanation comes out, I will update the post. However, feel free to speculate on what happened in the meantime.

Update 6 May 2014 : U-2 did indeed cause the LA-area ATC problem

The FAA admitted late yesterday that a U-2 did, in fact, trigger the problems last week with the LA-area ERAM system. Piecing together the FAA explanation from various news sources, e.g., NBC News, Reuters and CNN (no one seems to have published the FAA statement yet in its entirety):

“On April 30, 2014, an FAA air traffic system that processes flight plan information experienced problems while processing a flight plan filed for a U-2 aircraft that operates at very high altitudes under visual flight rules.” “The computer system interpreted the flight as a more typical low altitude operation, and began processing it for a route below 10,000 feet.” “The extensive number of routings that would have been required to de-conflict the aircraft with lower-altitude flights used a large amount of available memory and interrupted the computer’s other flight-processing functions.” “The FAA resolved the issue within an hour, and then immediately adjusted the system to now require specific altitude information for each flight plan.” “The FAA is confident these steps will prevent a reoccurrence of this specific problem and other potential similar issues going forward.”

The CNN story, which provides (so far) more detail than anyone else, indicates that the ERAM system was overtaxed because of the many waypoints the U-2 flight plan had filed. In addition, however, CNN reports that, “Simultaneously, there was an outage of the Federal Telecommunications Infrastructure, a primary conduit of information among FAA facilities.” CNN did not indicate what caused the FTI to go out, however.

Altogether, the complex U-2 flight plan and the FTI outage added up to what one government official said on background was a “perfect storm” that took down the ERAM system. Well, sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.

U.K. Airline Travelers Unhappy over Passport Control Failure

Los Angeles-bound passengers weren’t the only ones unhappy last Wednesday. International airports and ports across the U.K. experienced unbelievably long queues at passport control as the U.K. Border Force computers went down at around 2:30 p.m. London time and the outage lasted for some 12 hours. Some passengers at Gatwick reported waiting in line for over four hours, and fights were said to have broken out among passengers waiting in line at both Gatwick and Luton Airports. While non-EU passengers waited the longest, UK citizens also had to wait for up to two hours as well, newspapers reported.

The Home Office put out a statement that read in part, “We apologise for the delays that some passengers experienced at passport controls yesterday, but security must remain our priority at all times.” The Home Office also said that its technical staff has been asked “to look into the incident to ensure lessons are learnt.”

However, whether those lessons to be learnt will ever be publicly disclosed is still to be determined. The Home Office is refusing to disclose what caused the massive computer meltdown, which seems to be its standard operating policy.

Completing the trifecta of airport problems that occurred last Wednesday was a report that a construction crew cut a fiber optic cable at Florida’s Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport at about 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. The loss of the cable resulted in in dozens of flights being canceled, delayed, or rerouted. No doubt passengers trying to travel to the U.S. West Coast from the airport thought they were snake-bit.

More General Motor Recalls for Software Issues

General Motors announced two more vehicle recalls to correct software issues in its vehicles. First, it is recalling some 56 400 Cadillac SRX crossover vehicles from the 2013 model year because of a software problem in the SRX transmission control module. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, “In certain driving situations, there may be a three to four second lag in acceleration due to the transmission control module programming.” No crashes have been attributed to the issue, GM reports.

In addition, General Motors said it is issuing recalls for 51 640 Buick Enclave, Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia SUVs, from the 2014 model year that were built between 26 March and 15 August 2013. In these vehicles, GM says, the engine control software may cause the fuel gauge to read inaccurately the amount of fuel remaining, leading the vehicle unexpectedly running out of fuel. GM says it doesn’t know of any crashes that are linked to this problem, either.

2014-05-01T07:00:00Z,US Immigration Court System Server Outage Enters Week Six, 59 immigration courts have to revert to pencil and paper ,,,6,weeks,1008.0,,,,,US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/us-immigration-court-system-outage-enters-week-six,,U.S. Immigration Court System Outage Enters Week Six,"It’s been another slow news week in the world of IT-related errors, problems and failures. The most interesting IT Hiccup of the week involves a puzzling six-week outage affecting the computer system that supports U.S. Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) administered courts across the country.

About a month ago, the New York Post ran a story describing a “tech meltdown” involving five servers located in Falls Church, Virginia, on 12 April. The servers are an integral part of the computer system supporting the 59 immigration courts administered by the EOIR. According to the Department of Justice, the EOIR “primarily decides whether foreign-born individuals, who are charged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with violating immigration law, should be ordered removed from the United States or should be granted relief or protection from removal and be permitted to remain in this country.”

As a result of the outage, which also took out the mandatory electronic registry for accredited immigration attorneys and representatives, the 260-plus immigration court judges (and staff) have had to return to pencil-and-paper methods. As described at JDSUPRA.com, the problem has kept “court clerks from accessing court records, entering new ones in the system, and making audio recordings of hearings.”

An immigration judge from San Francisco put the situation this way in a Las Vegas Sun story: “Everything is connected to the court docketing system. Like everything these days, more and more things are inter-connected. To open up the court docketing system about a certain case, first it has to be scheduled and then I can pull up the part that allows me to record it.” Since immigration courts don’t have court reporters, the proceedings are recorded digitally and then transcribed later if they are later needed, the Sun article states. However, because of outage, judges are reportedly capturing information using cassette recorders.

The loss of the computer system has slowed down an already clogged immigration court system (there is a backlog of almost 360 000 court cases), and has forced the EOIR to note on its website that it has had to “prioritize caseloads to compensate for the reliance on manual processes.”

In addition, the “courts' notification system relies heavily on a toll-free hotline, which allows those in detention centers who don't have access to computers to check on the status of their cases and when their next hearings are. A recorded message warns callers that the hotline hasn't been updated since April 12,” according to a McClatchy News story. Immigration lawyers say that the outage has made it nigh unto impossible for them determine the status of their new clients’ cases.

When the EOIR computer system is fixed, of course, all the information captured manually over the past weeks is going to have to be entered into the computer system. Dana Leigh Marks, the president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, told McClatchy News that, “I imagine it will take us weeks to months to get caught up and make sure the computer system is completely caught up.”

The big question is when, exactly, will the EOIR computers be fixed?

Soon after the system went down, the EOIR Public Affairs Office put out a simple three-line statement (pdf) on 14 April saying that there was an outage, and that, “We hope to have this situation resolved in the near future.” A few days later, on 18 April, the EOIR posted a statement on its website stating that, “A hardware failure has resulted in the agency’s inability to perform some functions related to its computer systems… We are continuing to evaluate the problem and are hard at work to find a solution.”

The outage didn’t make the news until the New York Post story on 22 April. The Post's story stated the five servers needed parts which would not be available until sometime early May. A story the following day in Federal Computer Week cast doubt on the Post’s server meltdown story, instead citing “sources familiar with the situation” as indicating the issue was more of an access problem than a server problem.” FCW quoted EOIR spokeswoman Lauren Alder Reid as saying, “This isn't a long-term problem,” and reported that the “the solution won't require an extensive overhaul.” She refused to go into specifics of either the exact problem or the solution, “citing security concerns.”

Apparently, the unspecified “hardware failure” was a longer-term problem than was first expected. For on 9 May, almost a month after the outage occurred, another EOIR spokesperson, this time Kathryn Mattingly, told McClatchy News that, “Our staff is hard at work to bring everything back up to typical function, but we do not have an estimated timeline for a complete fix.” Again, the EOIR declined to give any more detail on what was going on.

Last week, a top but unnamed Department of Justice official told the Politico that, “Progress has been made in resolving the problems and a fix could be achieved by early next week.” We should soon have confirmation of everything returning to normal, then.

The Politico story added that Attorney General Eric Holder also refused to talk specifics about the problems plaguing the EOIR computer system at a news conference last week, but hinted strongly that Congress needed to increase its funding of the EOIR if it wanted to keep such problems from re-occurring. I wonder if that includes a working back-up system, which doesn’t seem to exist.

As highlighted in the Politico story, the nationwide EOIR computer outage has pretty much flown under the radar of most major news organizations and hasn’t triggered much of a response from the Obama Administration—other than to downplay its impact. One reason, the Politico reasons, is that, “those affected directly by the immigration court woes are not U.S. citizens or voters, though their families may be.”

That may be a (politically callous) part of it, but it's just as likely that the Obama Administration doesn’t want to call attention to another government IT problem in the wake of the ACA website mess. Whatever the reason, it does seem a sorry state of affairs that a major outage of a Federal computer system has dragged on for weeks with little more than a shrug of the shoulders from the administration and major news media alike.

2014-05-01T07:00:00Z,Massachusetts Pays Health Exchange Contractor a Total of $52 Million to Go Away, CGI paid $35 Million termination money on top of previous $17 Million paid ,,,,,,,5.2E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/massachusetts_health_connector_3.html,,Massachusetts Health Connector to pay $35 million to sever ties with technology vendor CGI over failed website,"The Massachusetts Health Connector will pay another $35 million to CGI, the company that created its problematic health insurance exchange website, as part of an agreement allowing the state to sever ties with CGI.

""This transition agreement allows us to close a difficult chapter in the (health insurance exchange) project and move us forward,"" said Maydad Cohen, a special assistant to Gov. Deval Patrick overseeing the fixes to the health insurance system.

Patrick said in a statement, ""This is a pragmatic way to wind up a frustrating relationship. CGI has been a disappointing partner. This agreement resolves intellectual property issues so that we can move forward in building a website that works.""

The state announced in March that it was severing ties with CGI after the new health insurance exchange, required by the Affordable Care Act, was plagued by serious glitches that left individuals unable to use the website to enroll in subsidized health insurance plans. The state has been managing the problems with a mix of temporary coverage that has cost the state millions of dollars, coverage extensions for existing public programs and labor-intensive manual workarounds. The state is now working to have a functioning system by the next open enrollment period in November. Massachusetts could join the federal healthcare.gov website, if it cannot get its own system working in time.

Since March, the state has been finalizing a transition agreement, which would allow CGI to transfer its knowledge and its ownership of the computer code to the state and its new technology contractor.

The state's original contract with CGI was for $89 million with payments due as parts of the project were completed. Until now, the state had paid just $17 million. The agreement signed Friday will cost the state another $35 million.

Cohen said $20 million of that will cover services that CGI and its subcontractors have already provided, including components of the system that the state is using successfully. Cohen said the state has not paid CGI for its work since November. ""They've been working for free for nearly 8 months,"" he said.

The remaining $15 million will cover the continuing cost of operating and maintaining the system as well as the cost of sharing CGI's knowledge of the system and its staff with the state and its new technology vendor, Optum. CGI will remain involved in the transition for up to 12 weeks, after which the ties will be severed.

Massachusetts also reserves the right to sue CGI to recoup up to $12 million. Cohen said Attorney General Martha Coakley's office has begun an investigation under the False Claims Act to determine whether there are grounds for a lawsuit. The False Claims Act lets the attorney general sue a company that submits false claims for payment to the state government related to contracting or purchasing issues.

Brad Puffer, a spokesman for Coakley, said in a statement, ""The failings of the CGI-developed web site have been unacceptable, and we are conducting an investigation into their actions to seek to recover money back for taxpayers. As that investigation is ongoing, we have no further comment at this time.""

Both the state and CGI agreed not to pursue any litigation beyond that.

CGI spokeswoman Linda Odorisio said in a statement, ""This agreement recognizes the important contributions made by CGI throughout the project and during the past three months, when hundreds of CGI professionals stayed on the job to help the Commonwealth clear its backlog, improve functionality, and prepare for a new deployment plan."" She said the 12-week transition period will allow the state and the company ""to best utilize the capabilities already in place and minimize the loss of knowledge and expertise.""

Odosorio said CGI ""will offer its full cooperation during the course of any examination of the Connector.""

The federal government originally gave Massachusetts a $174 million grant to develop the new health insurance system. Given the technological problems, the state does not yet have a full analysis of the final cost.

The Health Connector is current employing the technology company Optum to pursue two separate tracks to get a working site. It is customizing off-the-shelf software called hCentive, and it is also looking at joining the federal health exchange website if it cannot get hCentive working in time. Cohen said Friday that the state appears to be ""on track"" to get the hCentive software up and running by the open enrollment period.

State officials have estimated the cost of the ""dual-track"" plan at $120 million. But Secretary of Administration and Finance Glen Shor said the state is still negotiating its contract with Optum and is also looking at the availability of other federal grants for the Affordable Care Act that can be directed toward the project.

""Because there's still a number of moving parts, we're not able to say here's the cost of the project moving forward,"" Shor said. ""We're moving very expeditiously to resolving that.""

The agreement is unlikely to blunt criticism of the project. Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker has used the website debacle to criticize the Patrick administration and Coakley, who is a Democratic candidate for governor. ""The Massachusetts Health Connector disaster was completely avoidable, as administrators knew the system was not ready, yet decided to launch it anyway last fall,"" Baker said in a statement. ""The botched implementation of the Health Connector website has left thousands in health care limbo while wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Investigations cannot undo the taxpayer dollars wasted and the disruption of families' access to health care.""

Josh Archambault, director of health care policy at the conservative-leaning Pioneer Institute, pointed out that the latest money is being taken from U.S. taxpayers not to fund health care or health insurance, but to fund information technology infrastructure.

""If this amount of money was spent in the private sector with little to show for it, it would be tied to some form of accountability for those that failed in their oversight role,"" Archambault said in an email. ""Unfortunately for taxpayers, that has not been the case in the Commonwealth.""

This story has been updated to include Archambault's comments.

2014-06-01T07:00:00Z,Heathrow Terminal 5 Has Multi-day Baggage System Problems, Thousands of passengers fly without bags ,,,4,days,96.0,28000,,,,UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/thousands-of-bags-miss-flights-at-british-airways-heathrow-terminal-5-again,,Thousands of Bags Miss Flights at Heathrow Terminal 5 Again,"Here's some glitch déjà vu from 2008, namely another baggage system miscue involving British Airways (BA) at Heathrow International Airport in London. As you may remember, in March 2008, BA and Heathrow operator British Airports Authority (now known as Heathrow Airport Holdings) opened the long-awaited BA Terminal 5 with great fanfare, with BAA loudly proclaiming the “world-class” baggage system was “tried, tested and ready to go.” No Denver International Airport baggage system-like problems for them! And BA's deservedly poor reputation as the top airline for losing luggage would finally be over.

Of course, such publicly-stated optimism over the reliability of automation is rarely left unpunished. Almost immediately, a massive meltdown of the baggage system on the first day of T5’s operation led to more than 28,000 passenger bags piled high across the terminal, hundreds more being lost, and some 15 percent of BA flights being cancelled over the course of nearly a week. It took three weeks before the majority of bags were reunited with passengers. The extreme embarrassment for both BA and Heathrow management because of the incident was acute, as was BA passenger rage, to say the least.

The nightmares of that week have slowly receded from BA passengers' memories. That is, until Friday, 27 June, when London papers like the Daily Mail reported that T5’s automated baggage system had suffered another major IT failure, with bags having to be handled manually again. As a result, thousands of BA passengers were sent (unknowingly) on their way without their luggage, including those passengers transiting through London via T5. The Mail quoted a BA spokesperson as saying, “On Thursday morning, the baggage system in Terminal 5 suffered an IT problem which affected how many bags could be accepted for each flight… We are very sorry for the difficulties this has caused and we have been working hard with the airport to make sure we reunite all of our customers with their luggage as quickly as possible.”

The BA spokesperson failed to point out that the phrase “how many bags could be accepted for each flight” actually meant no bags were accompanying their owners on an untold number of BA flights. BA also insisted to the press that they stop saying that passenger bags were lost; the bags merely “missed” their flights, BA pouted.

A short two-paragraph Heathrow Airport Holdings press release did BA one better at trying to downplay the baggage system problem, stating that it affected only “some bags,” and that flights were in fact operating “normally.” You have to love press statements that are totally true but also totally disingenuous.

BA passengers on Thursday were naturally displeased at traveling without their bags, but at least they got to their destination, unlike those flying out of T5 last September, when another but very short-lived IT problem with the baggage system prevented hundreds of passengers from ever boarding their flights and had to be rebooked onto new ones, many the next day.

While BA passengers from June 27 were naturally miffed, what BA and Heathrow’s operator failed to make clear until early this week was that the “intermittent” IT problems with T5’s baggage system had actually begun on Thursday, 26 June and continued well into Sunday, 29 June. I am sure that many BA passengers flying out of T5 on June 28 and 29 would have changed airlines if they knew the full extent of the baggage problems. Conveniently, neither BA nor the airport operator came forward with the information about the multi-day operational problem until Tuesday, 1 July. Nor have they disclosed the total number of bags or passengers inconvenienced.

Both BA and Heathrow Airport Holdings are in damage control mode as BA passengers, many of them famous, have taken to social media to lambast them both. Many passengers, for example, have complained that when they finally did receive their bags, they had been ransacked with items stolen from them. Others complained that their journeys were over by the time their bags finally reached them.

BA put out another press release blaming international airline security rules for bags being opened as well as being delayed, and further promised to look into the ransacking claims. A BA spokesperson went on to apologize, stating that, “We are very sorry that this process is taking longer than anticipated, and we fully understand the frustration that this is causing.” Heathrow Airport Holdings new CEO John Holland-Kaye also apologized, saying the IT problem had taken too long to resolve and that airport needs “to do better.” Disclosing IT problems while they are occurring would be a good start.

The BA spokesperson went on to warn that it would still take “several days” before all the bags that “missed” their flights are reunited with their owners. BA also indicated that because of the number of bags involved, its bag tracking system was not working as it should, which could further add to the delays.

BA is reminding its customers flying out of T5 that, “You may wish to carry essential items in hand baggage where possible.” That is probably good advice. ComputerWorldUK reports that Heathrow Airport Holdings is remaining very tight-lipped over what caused the baggage system fault and why it took four days to fix it, which is rarely a good sign that everything is under control.

2014-08-01T07:00:00Z,Oracle Sues Oregon for $23 Million Over Health Insurance Exchange , Oracle says state owes it money for working health exchange ,,,,,,,2.48E8,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-oracle-oregon-lawsuit-20140809-story.html#page=1,,Oracle sues Oregon over botched Obamacare exchange,"The legal battle over Oregon's dysfunctional health insurance exchange officially began this week when Oracle Corp. sued the state agency operating the exchange, alleging breach of contract and accusing Gov. John Kitzhaber of attempting to systematically ""vilify the company in the media.""

In a 21-page complaint filed Friday in federal court for the District of Oregon, Portland Division, Oracle charges that during the early months of this year, state officials privately continued to request Oracle's help to fix their system while engaging in a campaign of ""constant public slander"" against the tech company.

Though Oregon had appeared more prepared than many other states to implement President Obama's Affordable Care Act, technology problems crippled Cover Oregon's online exchange. The web portal where consumers were to purchase health insurance never went live after open enrollment began on Oct. 1. Instead, the state resorted to paper applications to allow Oregonians to access health insurance subsidies through the new federal program.

Cover Oregon officials voted to scrap the troubled exchange in April, despite spending $248 million, and opted to transition to the federal system. The state had dismissed Oracle, the lead website developer for Cover Oregon, the previous month.

Kitzhaber, an emergency room doctor who is running for reelection, first asked the state's Attorney General to investigate the legal options and then in May publicly urged the office to sue.

But it was Oracle, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Redwood City, Calif., that fired the first shot against the state and Cover Oregon.

The company, which has built health insurance exchanges for half a dozen other states, claims that they are still owed $23 million by Cover Oregon under their contract.

The lawsuit notes that hundreds of thousands of Oregonians were enrolled in health insurance using the software built by Oracle and other companies. Customer service representatives and health insurance agents were able to use that software to enroll consumers in a back-office capacity, but the system was never made available for consumers to enroll directly on their own.

""While flogging Oracle publicly, Cover Oregon continued privately to ask for Oracle's help. (Indeed it continues to this day to seek Oracle’s technical help with the project),” Oracle’s legal complaint said. “Oracle gave that help for many months, in spite of the public excoriation, because it was committed to helping Cover Oregon complete the project and because Cover Oregon repeatedly promised to pay Oracle for its services. In the end, though, Cover Oregon reneged on its promises, thus prompting this lawsuit.”

Oregon ran into trouble in part because they attempted to build their healthcare exchange under the Affordable Care Act at the same time that they embarked on an ambitious project to modernize their health and human services programs.

Oracle alleges that the state made a series of mistakes, including the failure to hire a “systems integrator” that could manage the project -- a mistake that federal exchange officials also made causing problems with the initial performance of healthcare.gov. In the lawsuit, Oracle said Oregon’s decision to manage the project itself was akin to building “a massive multi-use downtown skyscraper without an architect or general contractor.”

State officials were overwhelmed by the task of managing dozens of subcontractors, Oracle alleges, particularly as they tried to assemble the pieces of the complex system and merge it with the state modernization project.

Oregon's projects were also hampered by disagreements among state officials, as revealed by two independent reviews of the debacle—one of which was commissioned by Kitzhaber. Cover Oregon and state officials repeatedly changed their mind about the scope of the work they wanted, Oracle said. In addition, Oracle alleges that Rocky King, the former Cover Oregon executive director, did not seem to grasp the extent of the technical problems his agency was facing.

Days before the website was supposed to launch on Oct. 1, King sent an email to an Oracle consultant underscoring that the Cover Oregon website should at least look good for consumers, even if it was not going to operate well.

“If the road is going to be be [sic] bumpy, let me at least be driving a good looking car,” King’s email said.

But Kitzhaber repeatedly criticized the quality of Oracle’s technical work. A federal technical review suggested that Oracle threw “bodies, rather than [a] skill set” at the website problems. And King, who stepped down earlier this year, criticized Oracle's technical work, stating during one public meeting that the company had finally sent home the “C-Team” and replaced it with the “A-team.”

Cover Oregon did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. But Kitzhaber’s office did not back down from his criticism of Oracle in a statement.

“The Governor is aware of the lawsuit and isn't surprised by it; the State fully expected to end up in litigation over Oracle's failure to deliver,” Kitzhaber spokeswoman Melissa Navas said in the statement. “The Attorney General's Office will review the complaint filed by Oracle and continue to pursue legal remedies on behalf of the State.”

Cover Oregon has paid Oracle $130 million so far, according to The Oregonian. That sum is more than a third of the federal grant money that Oregon received to build its independent exchange. The state was still able to enroll more than 430,000 people in new health insurance coverage or Medicaid through paper applications, with assistance from insurance agents, trained community partners and customer service representatives.

Cover Oregon recently signed an $18.4-million contract with Deloitte Consulting LLC to serve as the systems integrator as Oregon transitions over to the federal exchange before next year's open enrollment period begins on Nov. 15. Tina Edlund, Kitzhaber’s transition project director said the new contract with Deloitte “has the strictest oversight and accountability to ensure the vendor delivers.”

The federal Government Accountability Office is investigating what went wrong in Oregon, as well as several other states that chose to operate their own exchanges.","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency"

(You may may recall that happening in Maryland, New York, and Illinois a few years ago.)

While most of these “teething problems” are resolved during the first week or so of school, significant IT issues affecting the performance of the new integrated student educational tracking system recently rolled out in the Los Angeles Unified School District—the second largest in the country with 650,000 students—has already stretched beyond the first few weeks of the school term with no definitive end in sight. Furthermore, the many software bugs being encountered were known by LAUSD administrators, but they decided to roll out the system anyway.

The new system, called My Integrated Student Information Systems (MiSiS), was launched during the teachers' preparatory week before classes officially began on 11 August. Unsurprisingly, it did not go well. In fact, a few days prior to launch, LAUSD’s chief information officer Ron Chandler was quoted in the LA Times as saying that he expected the MiSiS launch “to be bumpy.” Chandler also added for emphasis, “It’s going to be messy. The question is just how messy.”

While some modules of MiSiS were rolled out last year, a more complete version was piloted during summer school this year and was claimed by LAUSD administrators as performing acceptably. Even under these more benign conditions, summer school staff noted several operational defects that needed fixing. While many were apparently fixed by early this August, a large number still remained open as MiSiS went live. In addition, MiSiS apparently was not fully stress tested as a complete system and under expected load conditions before its launch.

According to the Costra Contra Times, soon after MiSiS went live, staff across the school district began reporting issues ranging from painfully slow system performance to not being able to access student records at all. Other staff members reported that they were finding many of their students had been given the wrong class assignments, or worse, had not been assigned any classes at all.

Compounding the technical problems reported, the required user training on MiSiS for the more than 29,000 LAUSD teachers and school administrators was not completed before classes started, meaning there was a large number of school staff not fully trained on how to use MiSiS at its launch. So when problems were reported to the LAUSD IT department, it wasn’t clear how many were true technical problems versus user-unfamiliarity problems.

During the first week of school, local newspapers started reporting even more problems were cropping up with MiSiS. Some middle school students, for instance, were being placed in high school classes; while some teachers reported that they found 70 students assigned to their classes. At the end of the week, LAUSD administrators told teachers not to use MiSiS to take attendance until this week, so LAUSD IT specialists could have time to work on the system. LAUSD acknowledged at the same time that there were 130 known issues with MiSiS that needed to be worked through.

The second full week of school was less chaotic, but school staff and teachers were still reporting problems, even though LAUSD administrators insisted that MiSiS was working acceptably. School staff, on the other hand, reported they still were finding students with incorrect or missing class assignments which created classroom disruptions. Special education teachers reported MiSiS issues were proving especially troublesome. MiSiS performance wasn’t markedly faster, either.

However, LAUSD administrators tried to downplay the problems being reported, calling them merely a “blip” that everyone would soon forget. Administrators insisted that only about 6,500 students were affected by MiSiS-related issues, which they said wasn’t bad considering that MiSiS, according to CIO Chandler, was “easily one of the most complex technology programs going on in the planet right now.”

A bit of hyperbole that, I think.

LAUSD teachers unions strongly challenged the administrators' 6,500 figure, calling it a gross under-reporting of the true number of students affected. They demanded that MiSiS immediately be scrapped and that LAUSD revert back to the old student record management system, which the unions claimed worked much better.

That is not likely to happen unless MiSiS completely falls over dead. The reason is that MiSiS is the end product of a very long and convoluted series of court cases going back to 1993. In that year, the mother of a student named Chanda Smith sued the LAUSD for allowing her daughter to reach—and twice flunk—the 10th grade when it was known that her daughter had a documented learning disability for which she received special tutoring in middle school. Although Smith’s mother tried repeatedly to get Chanda into special education classes in high school, the LA school administrators refused to do so. The lawsuit soon turned into a class action suit as other parents of disabled students also complained about their children not receiving the educational help they required or had received previously.

To make a long story short, in 1996, LA’s school board acknowledged that the school system had violated state and federal laws on the treatment of disabled students, and entered into a court approved consent decree [pdf] detailing how it would improve the education of the school districts disabled students. There was a list of a dozen and a half or so of improvements LAUSD agreed it would make over the next five years, including the implementation of an automated student tracking system so that abled and disabled childrens' educational progress could be assessed and tracked from kindergarten to the end of high school.

However, LAUSD was slow to implement the changes it had promised, saying they were too expensive. In 2001, it was sued again, this time for non-compliance with the 1996 consent decree. In 2003, after much legal wrangling, a modified consent decree (pdf) was signed, under which LAUSD was to have made good on a new set of agreed improvements. The LAUSD promised these would be implemented by the end of 2006, including (once again) the implementation of a comprehensive student tracking system. The courts appointed an independent monitor who would assess and have significant power to say whether the LAUSD was indeed meeting the terms of the modified consent decree.

Progress on meeting the improvement objectives was steady, but still extremely slow. One of the bottlenecks was the implementation of that comprehensive student tracking system. From 2003 to 2009, LAUSD worked to implement an integrated student information system (ISIS), purchasing a commercial product called SchoolMax as a way to speed the process along. The LA Times reports that LAUSD spent $112 million on this effort.

However, LAUSD found, in its words, “many challenges with software development and SchoolMAX’s performance.” So, in 2012 LAUSD approached the independent monitor with a plan to internally redevelop the student tracking system used at the Fresno Unified School District, which he approved. The LAUSD claims that the new system, which the LA Times said cost $20 million to develop and now called MiSiS, would offer “greater flexibility, user-friendliness, and cost effectiveness.”

The hope is—assuming that MiSiS can be fixed—that LAUSD might finally get out from under the consent decrees stretching back to 1996.

This helps explain why the LAUSD administrators made the decision to roll-out MiSiS a few weeks ago, warts and all, and why it will never revert to back to a student tracking system that isn’t compliant with the 2003 modified consent decree. It will be interesting to see whether the independent monitor believes MiSiS actually does now meet the terms of the decree’s mandate. If the system is still buggy by the end of this year, and if special education teachers are still complaining about it, I suspect he will be none too sympathetic to lifting the modified consent decree.

One person who is definitely not pleased at the moment is LAUSD school board member Tamar Galatzan, who is calling for a full audit of MiSiS and the decisions behind its “bumpy” launch. Galatzan claims the school board was not informed of the potential MiSiS problems until the news hit the media.

MiSiS isn’t the only IT issue involving the LAUSD, either. Last week, the LA Times reported that an internal LAUSD analysis of the school district’s $1 billion initiative to provide an Apple iPad to every student “was beset by inadequate planning, a lack of transparency and a flawed bidding process.”

That sounds surprising familiar to what occurred a few years ago in regard to the LAUSD payroll system fiasco. A school district that doesn’t learn from past mistakes—more than a bit ironic, wouldn’t you say?

Experts have advised pulling the plug on the project because it would be ‘extremely problematic’ to continue, junior social affairs minister Jetta Klijnsma told parliament in a briefing on Tuesday.

The SVB has invested nearly €44m in the project since it began in 2006. The decision to scrap it will not have an impact on payments, the organisation said.

The system has been developed by computer services group Capgemini. A spokeswoman said the company regretted the delays in completing the project but declined to comment further, news agency ANP said.

Commission

Experts told a government commission looking into problems with a variety of government IT projects earlier this year the state has lost billions of euros through system failures.

Just 7% of the projects with a budget starting at €7.5m can be said to be successful, information science professor Hans Mulder told MPs in April. In total, 70% of projects fail.

Of those which flop, 36% fail so seriously the new system is never used and around half are of doubtful value because they turn out to be too expensive, take too long or produce unexpected results, Mulder said.","Netherlands,Project Failure,Government,National,Health and Human Services,,€,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,Project termination/cancellation"

I'll tell you all about that in a later post. Instead let me pick another interesting IT Hiccup from last week's hodgepodge of IT problems, snarls, and screw-ups: The Indiana’s Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) plans to refund some US $29 million plus interest to 180,000 customers for charging them an incorrectly calculated excise tax when they registered their vehicles. The BMV claimed the problem began during the initial changeover in 2004 to its then new $32 million System Tracking and Record Support (STARS) computer system.

According to the BMV’s press release [pdf], when a car is registered with the agency, state law requires that the vehicle be placed in a specific tax classification category based on its value. The value is calculated “using the price of the vehicle and applying an adjustment factor based upon Consumer Price Index [CPI] data related to increases in new automobile price.” The result of the value calculation is then entered into STARS which in turn uses it to automatically determine the excise tax that needs to be paid by the vehicle’s owner. For reasons that the BMV did not disclose, the STARS programming seems to have failed to take into account the adjustment factor for 180,000 out of over 60 million vehicles registered using the software system, resulting in that small subset of registrations being overcharged.

The BMV says it will be mailing out letters to those customers affected within the next month or so. However, those overcharged customers will still need to fill out the form enclosed in the letter and send it back to the state if they want to receive their refunds.

The miscalculation of the excise tax doesn’t just affect BMV customers, either. A percentage of the excise tax collected by the BMV is transferred to Indiana’s local and county governments, which are now going to have to repay an estimated $6 million back to the state. The BMV press release states that to help reduce the financial impact on local and county government budgets, the state will pay back the overcharged BMV customers and the interest they are owed. The local and county governments will then see their excise tax distributions reduced over the next two years to make up for the previous incorrect tax payments they received.

Like most of these types of incidents, this one has an interesting back story: According to the Post-Tribune, the excise tax error was only recently discovered when the latest Consumer Product Index data was being entered into STARS. Someone apparently started asking how the excise tax was being calculated, and this led to the discovery of the tax overcharges going starting in 2004.

In addition, the BMV press release states that Indiana Governor Mike Pence has authorized the BMV to appoint of an independent consulting company to audit the agency to ensure there are no more fee miscalculations. The reason, BMV Commissioner Don Snemis told the Associated Press, was that, “I don't want to discover any more errors after the damage has been done.” Snemis might have added that what he really didn’t want were any more errors disclosed as a result of yet another lawsuit against the BMV.

You see, the BMV settled a $30 million class action lawsuit last year for also overcharging the fees paid to it by some 4.5 million BMV customers when they obtained or renewed their driver's licenses between 7 March 2007 and 27 June 2013. The BMV was publicly embarrassed by the suit, and agreed to credit customer accounts for what it called the “inadvertent” overcharges. The lawyers suing the BMV, however, said the fees were actually imposed on Indiana drivers on purpose, something the BMV strongly denied.

Then in September of last year, the BMV was even more embarrassed when it had to admit that it had also discovered that it been overcharging customers on some 30 other fees. The BMV said that it would immediately be crediting customer accounts for any charges imposed going back six years, which was the statute of limitations. The BMV blamed “the errors on misapplying complex state laws governing more than 300 fees for various BMV services,” the Indianapolis Star reported.

Soon after the BMV admission, the same law firm of Cohen and Malad LLP that forced the earlier settlement (and earned $6 million off of it) brought a second class-action lawsuit against the BMV in October of last year asking the courts to force BMV to not merely issue credits, but instead issue full refunds. The lawsuit also demanded that there be a full accounting of all BMV overcharges, including when the overcharges were first discovered by BMV management. The law firm contended that BMV knew about the 30 plus fee overcharges for some time, and did nothing about them until the first lawsuit was filed. The BMV once more denied the charge, and countered that BMV customers were already made whole by the issuing of the credits to their accounts. Snemis also accused the law firm of Cohen and Malad of bringing the lawsuit as just a way of “seeking a very big fee.”

However, the Indianapolis Star reported in June that a video tape deposition given by a former BMV Deputy Director in fact indicated that the BMV has known about the overcharging for quite a while, but “secretly kept doing it for at least two years to avoid budget troubles.” The Journal Gazette further reported that the BMV is now trying to keep secret other depositions taken in the latest lawsuit against it, supposedly because the BMV claims that allowing them to become public would discourage others from testifying in the lawsuit, an excuse no one seems to be buying.

Another wrinkle to this story is that the STARS system itself has a long, controversial history of its own. The STARS system, as was mentioned, was initially introduced into the BMV in early 2004. However, continuing problems with it meant that the system it was supposed to replace, called BOSS, had to be used concurrently with STARS until July 2006, when BMV Commissioner Joel Silverman decided that the agency was to going to use STARS exclusively. It may have been during this cross-over period when the latest fee fiasco occurred.

Silverman’s decision did not turn out well. Angry BMV customers quickly found themselves waiting in long lines as many routine transactions were unable to be completed; online and self-service were also unavailable. Indiana state police also were said to be worried that they might arrest drivers without just cause or have to let drivers who should be arrested go free because the information being sent to them from the BMV appeared to be inaccurate.

It wasn’t until late August that BMV operations started resembling anything approaching normal. By then, however, former Gov. Mitch Daniels was forced to apologize for the on-going BMV problems in attempt to cool the ensuing political firestorm raised by the debacle.

By early September, Silverman decided that perhaps it was in everyone’s—and especially the governor’s—best interest to resign. No doubt helping Silverman’s decision along was his loud and forceful declaration within a week of STARS going live that the system was fixed when it obviously was not, as well as admitting (pdf) that none of the extensive system testing that was supposedly done showed any indication of problems later encountered. Obviously, all that extensive testing missed the current excise tax problem as well.

It took over a year for STARS to finally start to operate satisfactorily.

The fiasco is known as Umoja (“unity” in Swahili), but it might better be called Janga (disaster). The computerized management system that Secretary General Ban Ki-moon bragged would be an “organizational transformation,” is five years overdue, and more than $100 million over its original budget. It is barely in its early rollout stages, and as far back as 2011 has been tagged as a “failure of management.” It has been in a seemingly endless state of flawed turnaround ever since.

Now things are apparently much worse. Last week -- the day after Fox News asked questions about how the wobbly project was faring -- the U.N. announced on a Umoja information website that yet another major course correction was taking place. “Several critical elements,” the notice said, “must be addressed by the organization before further deploying Umoja.”

The delays affect some 44,000 U.N. employees, and amount to anywhere between five and eight months for the next stages of Umoja’s rollout, which had been most recently planned for November of this year and June of 2015. There will be more delays for other phases originally slated to take place in June 2016, though the overall completion date -- now 2018 -- is apparently not affected so far.

The latest frantic efforts came in response to a scathing report by the U.N.’s independent Board of Auditors on Umoja’ progress -- the third since 2011-- which is due to be discussed by the U.N. General Assembly during its just-opened session. The 40-page report declared that despite all of Ban’s team efforts, Umoja was still wallowing in management problems, tens of millions of additional dollars over budget and likely to run up a tab that the auditors said “is unknown.”

The report also bluntly stated that as a result of the administrative mess, “the Board can provide no assurance that expenditure to date is matched by the appropriate level of actual delivery,” and declared that an early rejigging of Umoja’s deployment schedule, which took place only last February, was “unlikely to be met.”

The auditors themselves urged that Ban’s team “reassess the feasibility of the budget and revised project timetable” that they had put together in February -- something that the U.N. is apparently doing now.

In fact, the auditors’ warnings went further. The rollout of Umoja as a financial management system for the U.N.’s peacekeeping operations and 17 of its 18 special political missions, they said in tightly restrained bureaucratic prose, had led to what seemed to be new levels of calamity.

The main cause, as in many previous areas of Umoja’s unhappy development, was inadequate preparation for the scale of the project and the challenges it faces in bringing order to a rickety patchwork of technologies, accounting systems, business practices and levels of expertise in the famously inefficient U.N. system.

Rather than following proper procedure, many of the staffers have apparently been using “workarounds, in particular in critical financial processes,” the auditors reported.

Some 4,000 U.N. employees on the system at the time of the auditors’ report -- the U.N. says 6,000 are on it now -- were apparently given neither the training in how to handle the new software, nor the direction on how it would change their working lives.

Rather than following proper procedure, many of the staffers have apparently been using “workarounds, in particular in critical financial processes,” the auditors reported -- in other words, bypassing the system, even as they were supposedly moving onto it.

The result: financial chaos in the U.N.’s peacekeeping operations, which were the first major beachhead for Umoja, and which were budgeted to cost some $8 billion in the 12 months starting in July 2013.

“At the time of preparation of the present report [June 2014],” the auditors declared, the U.N. administration “was unable to complete bank reconciliations, reconcile payroll or clear accounts payable documents” in peacekeeping operations.

So big was the mess, the auditors noted, that it “could affect the integrity of peacekeeping accounting and financial records and may indicate that key internal controls have been inoperable during the financial year.”

Translation: the entire bookkeeping system of U.N. peacekeeping operations may be so thoroughly messed up that no one could be really sure how the money was spent -- or misspent.

Moreover, the report added, “It was also not clear when the system and the new operating model would be stabilized” -- hence the recommendation for a new timetable delay.

The new delays, the auditors also noted, were going to cost money -- but how much wasn’t known, in part because the U.N. was refusing to come clean on the cost implications of the latest upheaval.

Adding to the vicious spiral, the cost of throwing current manpower at the many problems as they have emerged has also, in the auditors’ estimation, affected the further rollout of the system, meaning more delays are possible.

So far, the auditors note, Ban’s administration is forecasting that it will need $378 million -- $24 million more than the last approved budget for the project -- to get through about two-thirds of the early-stage rollout that they now delaying even more -- and at the current “burn rate” of funds will run through the approved $348 million by next June. The money was supposed to cover the whole of next year.

Moreover, there is another looming black hole in the project’s finance, known as “associated costs” attached to the project, for cleaning up data from old systems and making it compatible, additional staff training, and other cleanup exercises.

At the moment, Ban’s administrators are insisting that most of the associated costs will be met out of existing U.N. operating funds -- a position that a U.N. spokesman reiterated in response to questions from Fox News.

But as the auditors pointed out, that position amounts to merely kicking the can down the road: “there is no evidence that such budgets have been allocated or ring-fenced,” meaning officially set aside for the purpose.

Thus, “the full costs of the project, and the extent of extra work and dedicated resources required for implementation,” the auditors concluded, “remain unknown.”

The same goes for some $140 million to $223 million in efficiency savings that Ban’s managers continue to insist that the new system will produce -- even while additional costs are continuing to climb to still-unknown levels. The auditors remain deeply skeptical about that calculation.

In perhaps the worst indictment of all, the auditors underlined that U.N.’s mushy management hadn’t really changed, despite all the crises, re-schedulings and new rollout plans that had wobbled into view since Umoja began.

A fundamental problem is that Ban’s administration “is being hampered by the lack of a clear target operating model for the U.N.,” the auditors declared.

Translation: they have no vision of how they want the organization to operate in the 21st century reorganization they claim to be leading.

The absence of that strategic vision, the auditors warn, is likely to lead to more rejigging of the info-tech system further down the line -- and further blows to management’s ability to make the U.N. accountable for what it spends, and how.

According to the U.N.’s management, however, the situation is nothing like that grave.

On the U.N.’s Umoja website, for example, the new system as rolled out so far is extolled as “proving to be fully viable, operational, and is already providing significant improvements to the organization.”

To be sure, there were a few clouds on the horizon. In response to questions from Fox News about Umoja’s progress, a U.N. spokesperson said that “as expected during the initial period of a large enterprise system such as this, some teething problems were experienced.”

And despite what the Board of Auditors said in its report, when it came to problems with peacekeeping financial issues, the spokesman said, only “a few missions experienced payment reconciliation issues which have since been largely resolved.”

As for the board’s other dire concerns, the spokesman declared that the auditors “have confirmed that the Umoja solution is technically viable” -- although the auditors were worried about how the system was being misused, rather than its technical capabilities. The spokesman added that “the U.N. has in place the internal controls, and has since the time of the audit collected the necessary financial information” that the board’s examination had declared missing.

When it comes to the spiraling cost of the project, the spokesman declared that Secretary General Ban will offer “further details on project expenditures and any future resource requirements” in a report to the General Assembly.

And overall, “the Umoja project remains on track to bring the benefits to the organization originally envisaged at the outset of the project.”

Whether the U.N.’’s increasingly exasperated member states will believe that is another question, and one that especially affects the U.S., which is likely to pay the largest amount, around 28 percent, of the Umoja bill as it relates to peacekeeping operations.

Last December, member states were already unhappy about what they were hearing about the project’s delays and rising costs.

Nothing they are about to hear this year is likely to make them feel better.

Meantime, Secretary General Ban told a press conference as the General Assembly session kicked off that “At this time of turmoil, the next two weeks will highlight again the indispensable role of the United Nations in tackling global threats and seizing opportunities for common progress.”

Just in the nick of time, the U.S. Department of Justice's Inspector General released his latest in an ongoing series of reports [pdf] about Sentinel, the FBI’s electronic information and case management system. In this report, the IG focused on how Sentinel users felt about working with the system. Sadly yet unsurprisingly, the IG found that Sentinel is still suffering from some serious operational deficiencies two years after it went live.

Sentinel, you may remember, was finally deployed in 2012 as a replacement for the FBI’s legacy Automated Case Support (ACS) system, which was originally supposed to be superseded by the infamous US $170-million Virtual Case File system in late 2003 or early 2004. The VCF was itself a component of a larger FBI effort called Trilogy that was begun in 2001 to upgrade and modernize the FBI's IT systems. To best understand how and why VCF became infamous, you owe it to yourself to read “Who Killed the Virtual Case File?” Written by IEEE Spectrum's digital editorial director Harry Goldstein, it is a classic government IT project failure story that appeared in the September 2005 issue of Spectrum. For Agatha Christie murder mystery fans, Goldstein's story will immediately remind you of Murder on the Orient Express.

Anyway, the origins of Sentinel—which the DOJ Inspector General succinctly describes as providing “records management, workflow management, evidence management, search and reporting capabilities, and information sharing with other law enforcement agencies and the intelligence community”—go back to 2005. The system has carried with it the FBI's hopes that it would permanently erase the unpleasant memories associated with the Virtual Case File debacle. At one time, those hopes looked like they might be fulfilled, as even the usually highly critical U.S. Government Accountability Office, which lambasted the FBI for its VCF risk mismanagement, called the original $425 million Sentinel acquisition a procurement model for the FBI.

A Rocky Start and a Surprise Recovery

Alas, those hopes faded as troubles began to plague the Sentinel project. Lockheed Martin, which won the prime contractor role in March 2006, was removed from its leadership position in 2010 after a devastating independent assessment by MITRE. The assessment indicated that the project, which at that point was into the taxpayers for $461 million and already past its original 2009 completion date, would take at least another $351 million and six more years to complete.

In the wake of the MITRE assessment, plus withering criticism of the project [pdf] by the IG and others, the FBI decided its best course of action was to take over control of the project itself. The FBI decided to take an agile programming approach to try to finish the project quickly and without blowing the budget. To everyone’s surprise, the Bureau successfully deployed Sentinel in July 2012 at a total cost of around $500 million.

I say around $500 million because even the IG doesn’t seem to have a really good handle on Sentinel’s true costs: IT development, operations and maintenance, plus FBI personnel and other internally-borne IT costs are not easily accounted for. For example, the FBI is still operating legacy IT systems that were supposed to be replaced by Sentinel, and those costs are not counted against the cost of Sentinel. The IG reports today’s obligated cost of Sentinel is $551.4 million, not counting the tens of millions of dollars in related FBI internal costs that were and are still being incurred.

The Sentinel project’s unexpectedly smooth roll-out won it many laurels and accolades (including its own). It was even named a ComputerWorld Honors Program 2013 Laureate. And since its 2012 roll-out, there has been nary a perturbing peep about Sentinel in the press.

It Glitters, But It's Not Gold

However, according to the inspector general's latest report, while “Sentinel has had an overall positive impact on the FBI’s operations, making the FBI better able to carry out its mission, and better able to share information,” there remain major problems with Sentinel’s two critical functions of searching for and indexing case information.

The IG report states that Sentinel’s search function is supposed to provide users the ability to locate cases and specific case-related information within Sentinel, while the indexing function's role is to designate and modify the relationship between any two identifiers, such as the relationship between a person and that person’s address. The proper indexing of Sentinel records is critical if FBI agents are to be able to “connect the dots,” the IG states.

For instance, the IG provides the following example:

“Indexing allows Sentinel to add structure to the data it contains, which in turn enables improved search results. [For example], a search for white males who drive black cars using a search engine like those used for internet searches would return all documents that mention any of the following: white males, black males, white cars, or black cars. By adding structure to the data through indexing, Sentinel’s search function is able to return only white males who drive a black car. When a user indexes an entity, the system will suggest potential matches already indexed in Sentinel.”

But the IG found in a survey of FBI agents that only 42 percent stated they “often received the results they needed” from Sentinel. Some 59 percent reported that they “sometimes, rarely, or never received the results they needed.” The IG also said that some survey respondents commented that the search function of the old ACS system was better than Sentinel’s! Furthermore, the IG stated that two issues kept frustrating the system’s users: “Sentinel returned too many search results for a person to reasonably review or no results at all for a document the user knew existed.”

In addition, the IG noted that soon before Sentinel was rolled out in July 2012 to all that acclaim, FBI management was boasting to the IG [pdf] that “the search function is both flexible and powerful enough to accommodate the substantial volume and wide variety of information available for retrieval.” However, according to information uncovered by the IG, at the same time FBI management was singing praises to Sentinel's search function the it knew there were major deficiencies with Sentinel’s search function.

The inspector general didn’t outright state it in his report, but reading between the lines you can see an IG clearly peeved that the FBI wasn’t honest in 2012 (or over the past two years, for that matter) about the true operational state of Sentinel's search capability and how it has hindered FBI personnel. The IG also cast some indirect doubt on how well the FBI’s highly touted agile approach worked: it may have helped save money and get Sentinel up and running quickly. But the question one has to ask now is, at what operational cost?

The IG also found that Sentinel’s indexing function wasn’t popular with users either. FBI Special Agents who now have to index their own case files (they used to hand the function off to an administrative staff member) complain that the process is a major administrative burden, and are frustrated that it “leaves less time for investigative activities."" A full 41 percent of survey respondents “reported that they spent more time indexing in Sentinel than they did in ACS.”

I can’t be sure, but I'd bet that with Sentinel (and probably going back to VCF), FBI management wanted to reduce personnel costs by moving the task of indexing from administrative staff to Special Agents. They also probably reasoned that the move would improve the accuracy of the indexing. But as often happens in these cases, the “cost savings” usually turn out to be an illusion.

In fact, FBI management initially told the IG “that the FBI is not currently able to provide Special Agents in the field with assistance in reducing the time it takes to index large structured documents such as bank records, or unstructured documents such as a report of investigation form … or email.” In other words, there is no money to hire admins to do the case indexing grunge work. The IG responded that the FBI better find a technological solution and soon.

There are several other operational deficiencies listed in the IG report, which I won’t go over. Interestingly, some of these seem to be less of a design flaw and more of a combination of comfort with using technology and organizational memory of how things used to be. For instance, users with fewer than 10 years of FBI tenure, and especially those with fewer than 5 years, found it easier to use Sentinel’s search function than those with much longer tenures at the Bureau. That said, 25 percent of “tech savvy” users, still found the search function difficult to learn.

The IG made one telling statement in his report that should trouble all taxpayers in the United States: “Based on the feedback received from Sentinel users, we are concerned that Sentinel does not appear to have met users’ expectations and needs.”

FBI management admitted that there are indeed some issues with Sentinel, but also told the IG that fixes are on the way. In October, the FBI said, there is going to be a major Sentinel software release that will help address many of the concerns the IG raised in his report.

The problems with Sentinel’s search may take longer to resolve, however. FBI management promised the IG that it will begin soliciting user feedback in regard to how to improve the search function. The Bureau will then develop and implement solutions to increase search functionality and operational efficiency. The IG agreed to the FBI's proposed approach but indicated that he was now going to be taking a “trust, but verify” perspective to the statement's made by FBI management. The IG stated that in future he wanted from the FBI “a detailed description of the change[s] made and how the search function was improved as a result.”

As the old saying goes, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. The IG has made it crystal clear to FBI management that he isn’t going to be fooled again.

Among them were: problems with the Los Angeles Unified School District’s fouled up new student information and management system that are so egregious that a judge ordered the district to address them immediately; and the UK Revenue and Customs department’s embarassing admission that its trouble-plagued modernized tax system has again made multiple errors in computing thousands of tax bills. However, the winner of this week’s title as the worst of the worst was an oofta by Duke Energy, the largest electric power company in the U.S. Duke officials apologized in a press release to over 500,000 of the utility’s 800,000-plus current and former customers (including 5,000 non-residential customers) across Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio for erroneously reporting them as being delinquent in paying their utility bills since 2010.

Duke Energy admitted that the root cause of the problem was a coding error that occurred when customers opted to pay their monthly utility bills via the utility’s Budget Billing or Percentage of Income Payment Plan Plus (in Ohio only). A company spokesperson told Bloomberg BusinessWeek that while customers were sent the correct invoices and their on-time payments were properly credited, the billing system indicated that the customers’ bills were paid late.

As a result, that late payment information for residential customers was sent by formal agreement to the National Consumer Telecom & Utilities Exchange (NCTUE). The NCTUE is a consortium of over 70 member companies from the telecommunications, utilities and pay TV industries that serves as a credit data exchange service for its members. Holding over 325 million consumer records, NCTUE provides information to its members regarding the credit risk of their current and potential customers. For non-residential customers, the “late payment” snafu had worse consequences: the delinquency reports were sent to the business credit rating agencies Dun & Bradstreet and Equifax Commercial Services.

Duke Energy’s press release said that the company “deeply regretted” the error that has effectively trashed the credit scores of hundreds of thousands of its residential and business customers for years. The utility says the erroneous information has now been “blocked” for use by the NCTUE, Dun & Bradstreet and Equifax, and it has dropped its membership in all three.

The press release mentioned that the company is still investigating whether additional customers who had “unique” billing circumstances were affected by the coding error.

But what the written statement failed to mention is that the utility found the error only after a former customer discovered that she was having trouble setting up service at another NCTUE utility member because of a supposedly poor payment history at Duke Energy. After contacting Duke Energy and asking why she was being shown as a delinquent bill payer when she was not, the utility realized that the woman’s erroneous credit information was only the tip of a very large IT oofta iceberg.

While Duke Energy claims that “we take responsibility” for the error, it is being rather quiet about explaining what exactly “taking responsibility” means for the hundreds of thousands of customers who may have been unjustly financially affected by the erroneous information sent to the three credit agencies over the past four years. It wouldn’t surprise me to see a class action lawsuit filed against Duke Energy in the near future to help the company gain greater clarity on what its responsibility is.

The Air Force is entering the stretch run of implementing its massive, multibillion dollar financial management system, an enterprise resource planning initiative to consolidate all of its ERP systems into one organization.

The service’s Life Cycle Management Center has awarded a $77.8 million contract to Accenture Federal Services for the final phase of the Defense Enterprise Accounting Management System, according to a defense department release.

DEAMS is the Air Force’s effort to comply with the Defense Department’s Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan. It was first implemented at Scott Air Force Base, Ill., in May 2010. Other early-deployment sites include the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, McConnell Air Force Base, Kan., Joint base Lewis-McChord, Wash. Servicewide deployment was to start gaining steam during the summer.

Initiated in 2003, DEAMS has, like just about any large, long-term IT project, seen its life cycles costs balloon—from a projected $1.1 billion to an estimated $2.2 billion—and its expected completion dates slip. Once expected to be fully deployed in 2014, the Air Force is now targeting April 2017. Along the way, it’s taken its fair share of hits from the Government Accountability Office and the DOD Inspector General, for failures ranging from a lack of thorough risk analysis to defects in software code.

In the final phase, DEAMS eventually will be implemented at every Air Force base around the world.","US,Operational Failure,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency,ERP"

(That group includes NatWest, Northern Ireland’s Ulster Bank, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.) The meltdown began in June 2012 but wasn’t fully resolved until nearly two months later. The collapse kept 17 million of the Group’s customers from accessing their accounts for a week, while thousands of customers at Ulster Bank reported access issues for more than six weeks.

Last week, Sky News reported that the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) informed RBS that it was facing record breaking fines in the “tens of millions of pounds” for the malfunction, which was blamed on a faulty software upgrade. In addition, the Sky News story states that the Central Bank of Ireland is looking at imposing fines on Ulster Bank over the same issue. The meltdown has already cost RBS some £175 million in compensation and other corrective costs.

In the wake of another major RBS IT system failure last December, RBS CEO Ross McEwan admitted the bank had neglected its IT infrastructure for decades. Last year, RBS said it would be spending some £450 million to upgrade its IT systems, but that figure was upped to over £1 billion this past June.

According to Sky News, RBS “could receive a discount of up to 30 percent on the proposed penalty if it agrees to settle within the 28-day window under FCA rules.” Seeing how RBS already has admitted that it has been short-changing its IT investiment, it is hard to see why the bank would decide to contest the fine.

In a separate story, Sky News reported that the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), which is part of the Bank of England, has sent a letter to the UK’s biggest banks “demanding” that they improve the resilience of their IT systems. The PRA has given the banks until mid-December to report on what they are doing to ensure their IT systems are robust.

Some wags wondered, however, whether the PRA was going to be conducting a resilience assessment of the Bank of England’s IT systems. That bank suffered a highly embarrassing outage of its own a few weeks ago.

If you like your IT turkey burnt to a crisp, over-stuffed with project management arrogance, served with heapings of senior management incompetence, and topped off a ladleful of lumpy gravy of technical ineptitude, you’ll feast mightily on the IG report. However, if you are a parent of the over 1,000 LAUSD school district students who still have not received a class schedule nearly 40 percent of the way into the academic year—or a Los Angeles taxpayer for that matter—you may get extreme indigestion from reading it.

However, the winner of the latest IT Hiccup of the Week award goes to Microsoft for the intermittent outages that hit its Azure cloud platform last Wednesday, disrupting an untold number of customer websites along with Microsoft Office 365, Xbox Live , and other services across the United States, Europe, Japan, and Asia. The outages occurred over an 11-hour (and in some cases longer) period.

According a detailed post by Microsoft Azure corporate vice president Jason Zanderon, the outage was caused by “a bug that got triggered when a configuration change in the Azure Storage Front End component was made, resulting in the inability of the Blob [Binary Large Object] Front-Ends to take traffic.”

The configuration change was made as part of a “performance update” to Azure Storage, that when made, exposed the bug, and “resulted in reduced capacity across services utilizing Azure Storage, including Virtual Machines, Visual Studio Online, Websites, Search and other Microsoft services.” The bug, which had escaped detection during “several weeks of testing,” caused the storage Blob Front-Ends to go into an infinite loop, Zander stated. “The net result,” he wrote, “was an inability for the front ends to take on further traffic, which in turn caused other services built on top to experience issues.”

Once the error was detected, the configuration change was rolled backed immediately. However, the Blob Front-Ends needed a restart to halt their infinite looping, which slowed the recovery time, Zander wrote.

The effects of the bug could have been contained, except that Zander indicated someone apparently didn’t follow standard procedure in rolling out the performance update.

“Unfortunately the issue was wide spread, since the update was made across most regions in a short period of time due to operational error, instead of following the standard protocol of applying production changes in incremental batches.”

Zander apologized for the “inconvenience” and says that it is going to “closely examine what went wrong and ensure it never happens again.”

Amber Anderson, press secretary to Ontario’s Community and Social Services Minister Helena Jaczek, confirmed the incident Friday evening.

Anderson said the province, which manages 500,000 Ontario Works (OW) and Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) cases, moved to fix the problem with the new software platform in “24 hours.”

Anderson said 11,000 of the overpayments were corrected right way but 6,000 cases may have received payments — mostly through direct deposits and the rest through mailed-out cheques. In those cases the province had to arrange for a stop payment, or a reverse transaction.

In 250 cases the overpayments are still outstanding, and the province has reached out to case workers to help get the money back from recipients.

“If there was an overpayment, we expect to be paid back,” said Anderson.

The new system — this is its first week of rollout — was set up to deliver social assistance more efficiently, and allow caseworkers to spend more time with their clients.

The Social Assistance Management Systems (SAMS), which took four years to develop and implement, replaces an outdated computer system Ontario previously used.

Anderson said the ministry is in some cases using “manual validations” to ensure the new system is working properly.

Also, additional ministry staff have been assigned locally to help front-line staff manage SAMS.

The problems have been particularly acute in Hamilton and the city’s Ontario Works caseload, according to city manager Michael Kirkopoulos.

City staff have been meeting daily to assess the immediate and long-term “challenges” with implementing the new system, and technical issues include over and under-payments, Kirkopoulos said in an emailed statement to the Star late Friday.","Canada,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - customers affected,Impact - Currency"
2014-12-01T07:00:00Z,New Jersey Cancels $118 Million Social Welfare Computer System Contract with HP," Original cost was $83 Million in 2007 for a six year project, government and contractor mismanagement cited ",,,,,,,8.3E7,$,USD,US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://spectrum.ieee.org/riskfactor/computing/it/new-jersey-finally-cancels-118-million-social-welfare-computer-system,,New Jersey Finally Cancels $118 Million Social Welfare Computer System,"We end this year’s IT Hiccups of the Week series much like how we began it, with yet another expensive, incompetently managed, and ultimately out-of-control U.S. state government IT project spiraling into abject failure. This one involves the New Jersey Department of Human Services’ six-year, $118.3 million Consolidated Assistance Support System (CASS). It was supposed to modernize the management of the state’s social welfare programs, but it was CASS itself that was in dire need of assistance.

The Department of Human Services decided to announce that it had pulled the project’s plug over the Thanksgiving holiday—no doubt to try to reduce the bad publicity involved while people were enjoying their much-easier-to-swallow, non-IT turkey. A DHS spokesperson would not explain why the CASS contract was terminated; her only related comment made to a NJ.com reporter was that “an analysis is in progress to determine next steps.”

Hewlett-Packard, which was the CASS project prime contractor (the contract was originally awarded to EDS in 2007; HP acquired the firm in 2008), was equally mum on the subject. However, an HP spokesperson did seem to hint strongly that any and all project problems were the fault of New Jersey’s DHS, when he stated that, “Out of respect, HP does not comment on customer relationships.”

Last week, an audit report (pdf) by Stephen Eells, New Jersey’s state auditor, showed why both DHS and HP did not want to discuss why a system touted as “New Jersey's comprehensive, cutting-edge social service information system” had turned into a debacle. According to the report, both DHS and HP botched the project nearly from its outset in August 2009. The audit report, for example, found HP’s overall technical performance “poor,” due in part to the company’s “absentee management.” HP has changed project managers on the eight-phase CASS effort three times since 2010. One of the managers the state rejected, Eells stated, because they lacked the qualifications “to manage such a large project.”

The audit report also notes that while the CASS contract cost was $118 million (it was originally $83 million), the state’s own project-related costs added up to an additional $109 million. According to a NJSpotlight.com article, Eells, in testimony last week before New Jersey’s Human Services Committee, made it clear that the state botched its CASS oversight role as well. DHS senior management, he indicated, consistently ignored red flags that the project was in deep trouble, and apparently failed to bring “concerns over the contract to the Department of Treasury, which is responsible for ensuring that problems with contracts are resolved.”

Eells also ruefully noted that the state’s contract with HP didn’t “allow the state to recoup damages from the failure to complete the contracted work.” A minor oversight, one might say.

The Human Services Committee wasn’t able to find out why DHS ignored the warnings that the CASS project was in trouble or failed to report the contract troubles to the state department that really needed to know about them, either. This void in the record is because DHS Commissioner Jenifer Velez “declined to speak at the hearing, citing the ongoing talks with Hewlett-Packard,” NJSpotlight.com reported.

I tend to doubt that the Commissioner will ever explain why her department’s IT managers chose to ignore the facts screaming out to them that the CASS project was on the fast track to failure, or why her department’s contract managers failed to protect state taxpayers from the cost of failure as is routiniely done. It’s not like the Commissioner is personally accountable for what happens on her watch or anything.

Reverberations from the glitch extended from Heathrow and Gatwick airports east into continental Europe as well as Scotland, Ireland and some trans-Atlantic flights to the United States. The effects were compounded by heavy pre-Christmas travel.

The scene was chaotic at Heathrow, Europe’s busiest airport, with lines of exasperated passengers at the British Airways terminal demanding information.

“It’s been absolutely appalling,” said Agnes Konalska, 35, who was trying to fly to Madrid. “There are just two information desks offering assistance. I’ve been running around for three hours trying to find out what’s been going on.”

Aviation officials blamed what they described as a technical problem at an air traffic control center in Swanwick, England, that has been hit with periodic maladies since it opened in 2002, six years behind schedule.

The government agency responsible for air traffic control, called NATS, said the breakdown began at 3 p.m., forcing a restriction on flights. It took 90 minutes to fix but air traffic did not start returning to normal until the evening.

NATS apologized in a statement, saying “it will take time for operations across the U.K. to recover so passengers should contact their airline for the status of their flight.”

The precise nature of the problem was not disclosed. While NATS said it was not a power outage, some reports said it was a glitch in the computer software that sequences takeoffs and landings.

It could not have come at a worse time for Heathrow, which handles 72 million passengers a year. The airport said at least 50 flights were canceled. Delays also disrupted Gatwick, which handles 35 million passengers annually.

One Heathrow staff member said he normally worked in finance but had been drafted to help assuage the crowds of anxious passengers. “A lot of people are very confused but we’ve been calming them down,” he said. “To be fair, it could be better, the airlines could be giving us more information.”

Express trains from London to Heathrow were suspended, but the London subway continued to operate to the airport.

Air France said that about 20 flights were affected and a Paris-to-Dublin flight was turned back. At least two Iberia flights were ordered to return to Madrid.

Airports in northern and central England, including Birmingham and Manchester, were unaffected.

The Swanwick center also controls flights over Stansted, Luton and London City airports, and all were affected by delays, as were Bristol and Leeds airports.

The transport minister, Patrick McLoughlin, said that “disruption on this scale is simply unacceptable,” and he demanded “a full explanation” from NATS. Normally, air traffic control systems are designed with redundancy to cope with technical problems.

The NATS control center said that “every possible action is being taken to assist in resolving the situation and to confirm the details.” NATS is a public-private partnership that provides air navigation services at Heathrow and a dozen other British airports.

Last December, a computer problem at Swanwick took 12 hours to fix. Another NATS control center is in Scotland.

Most passengers at Heathrow were not initially aware of the problem. Vicky Lane, a passenger on a grounded London-to-Dublin flight at Gatwick, told the BBC, “We’ve been stuck on a Ryanair flight” for over an hour. “The doors are open and we’re really cold. I’m not sure when we will be leaving.”

But the problems mounted. Philip Speirs, 71, trying to fly to Madrid on an around-the-world trip, was waiting in a long line to get information. “It’s been very civilized actually, but should be better managed,” he said. “This queue is spiraling and spiraling round, I think we’ll be here for a while. Just shows you how dependent they are on computers!”

Ross Jamieson, 27, trying to fly to Glasgow, said that he had been in line for an hour to try to book a hotel after his flight was canceled. “We arrived here at 2 p.m., and it’s now gone 6,” he said. “It’s been annoying and frustrating and now I just want to go to the pub.”

It was unclear whether the cause of Friday’s software glitch was related to any previous air traffic computer outages. Paul Beauchamp, a NATS spokesman, declined to provide further details, saying the agency was still investigating the incident. “The priority is getting everyone moving again,” Mr. Beauchamp said.

In 2004, a Swanwick computer problem grounded scores of flights across Britain. An even more serious glitch in September 2008 grounded hundreds of flights and affected tens of thousands of travelers.

The 2013 failure at Swanwick was particularly bad because it came at the beginning of the holiday season. After calm was restored, NATS chief Richard Deakin called that failure a “one-in-10-year event.”","UK,Operational Failure,Commercial,,,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - duration,Impact - duration unit,airport/port/customs/systems"

2015-01-01T07:00:00Z,Ontario's Admits it May Take Another 10 Weeks to Fix Problems with  Social Assistance Management Systems (SAMS) , Over CN$5 Million spent on extra staff so far to fix on-going problems with system ,,,10,weeks,1680.0,,5000000,$,CAD,Canada,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/01/30/internal-memo-shows-welfare-computer-system-problems-drag-on.html,,Internal memo shows welfare computer system problems drag on,"A leaked internal memo from the province identifies nearly a dozen key problems with Ontario’s $242 million welfare caseload computer system, issues a senior official says will take about 10 weeks longer to resolve.

The issues with the SAMS computer software system include difficulties inputting additional benefits for welfare recipients, problems adding and removing clients from the system, and entering information about household relationships into clients’ files.

Richard Steele, an assistant deputy minister with Community and Social Services, sent the memo last Friday to the social assistance operations division, which he oversees.

A leaked copy of the memo was provided to the Star.

“We now have a comprehensive view and understanding of the issues and a clear sense of priorities,” from the perspective of workers in the field, Steele says in his memo.

This understanding is supporting the development of a plan that will target resolving the problems over the next “10 or so weeks,” Steele writes. He said extra resources are coming to support the workers using SAMS.

Critics of the problem-plagued SAMS (Social Assistance Management System) software say its rollout has been a fiasco since the system launched Nov. 11 and point to Steele’s memo as further proof of that.

New Democratic Party MPP Cindy Forster, (Welland), her party’s community and social services critic, said Ontario Works and ODSP (Ontario Disability Support Program) caseworkers have told her they believe it’ll be another six to 12 months to solve the numerous issues with SAMS.

“They’re saying 10 weeks in this memo, but the information I’ve been given by front line workers and managers is six to 12 months before this is anywhere near fixed,’’ Forster said in an interview. The NDP obtained the memo.

When asked by the Star about the memo, a spokesperson for Community and Social Service Minister Helena Jaczek said many of the problems with SAMS identified in the correspondence already have “temporary fixes and alternative processes:” that ensure “direct client impacts can be avoided in most cases.”

“We have already made significant progress since November in many areas and are dedicating more staff resources to help local offices work through their unique challenges (with SAMS),” Jaczek’s press secretary Amber Anderson said in a statement this week.

Steele says in his memo that he remains confident the core of the SAMS system is “working well.”

After learning of the memo’s contents, Progressive Conservative MPP Bill Walker (Grey-Bruce-Owen Sound), his party’s community and social services critic, said he’s concerned about what costs SAMS will “balloon to” if the almost year-long timeline that caseworkers have told him it will take to fix SAMS materializes.

Aside from the $242 million project cost for SAMS, the ministry says another $16 million is being spent — $5 million of that “unanticipated” costs mostly for overtime and backfill — in operating funds for the system, the province says.

On top of that, it’ll cost an estimated $40 million from January to October of this year for “post-implementation transitional operating costs” including ongoing IT staffing and IBM support to run SAMS, the province said in a recent statement to the Star.

SAMS is expected to cost up to $37 million a year to run after that. Its predecessor system, SDMT cost about $40 million a year to operate.

The worst SAMS “glitch” happened about two weeks after it launched in November, when the province was forced to scramble to stop or recover $20 million in overpayments the system assigned to 17,000 welfare recipients.

The system has also been blamed for issuing underpayments to clients.

Forster said workers want to see specialized trouble shooting teams fan out to all the municipal OW and provincial ODSP offices and fix SAMS’ numerous glitches.","Canada,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency"

Unknown how much had been spent before cancellation. ,,,,,,,,,GBP,Oman,Project Failure,Government,National,Transportation,Air Transport,http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/engineering/11364553/Ultra-Electronics-has-airport-IT-contract-in-Oman-terminated.html,true,Ultra Electronics has airport IT contract in Oman terminated,"Ultra Electronics shares have dipped after the company said its contract to update the IT systems at Oman airport had been terminated.

The FTSE 250 technology group won the work in 2011 after a two-year tender process and valued the deal at £207m at the time.

On Friday morning Ultra said it had been informed late the previous day that the contact had been terminated.

Ultra said it would start discussions with the Oman about a settlement for the work it had carried out.

The company warned that the loss was likely to result in a provision against contract balances in its 2014 results, although 2014 cash would not be affected. It added the impact on full year 2015 underlying profit was expected to be minimal.

Announcing the contract win in 2011, Ultra said it would partner with Oman Investment Corporation for the IT programme in the Middle East nation and would act as the master systems integrator for the new terminal developments at Muscat and Salalah airports.

The company said that the airports were being developed to be capable of handling 58m passengers a year between them. Ultra said it would leverage its experience working on similar projects at Heathrow and Shanghai airports to deliver the work.

When it revealed it had landed the work, Ultra said the project was expected to create about 450 jobs, with about half of the contract’s value being awarded to local Omani companies.","Oman,Project Failure,Government,National,Transportation,Air Transport,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency,airport/port/customs/systems"

According to a letter obtained by The Sacramento Bee, state Sen. Mark Leno, who leads the Senate budget committee, informed Finance Director Michael Cohen that his request for more money on behalf of the Department of Consumer Affairs is a no-go, at least for now.

Leno, D-San Francisco, wrote that the Brown administration “has failed to provide adequate information necessary to inform the Legislature’s review and decision-making,” such as how the department will move the BreEZe project forward and how its higher costs will impact license fees.

About a quarter of the 40 regulatory boards, bureaus and commissions in Consumer Affairs have implemented the system since fall 2013, aiming to streamline and automate work. After a bumpy start, some of the bugs have been fixed and some units have adjusted. Still, a recent state audit hammered the department for failing to adequately access its business needs and monitor the project, noting that more than 1,000 defects remain in the system.

The estimated BreEZe budget has ballooned from $28 million to $96 million. The department has spent nearly $37 million so far.

Consumer Affairs officials also sought legislative permission to cut ties with the BreEZe vendor, Accenture, once the second of three planned BreEZe phases launched. They asserted, according to Leno’s letter, that delaying the move would cost the state about $1.3 million each month the company is still under contract, plus another $400,000 per month for other state staff and contractors.

“While I expect the Administration will make every effort to minimize the costs ... on balance, I believe that it is worth the risk,” Leno wrote, so that the Legislature could act once it has more information. “I will reconsider the merits of the proposed approach following upcoming legislative oversight hearings” in the next few months.

“We really are a changed administration,” Corder told the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee. “It was not us. It was the previous administration. … Superintendent Ybarra did not create that problem, but Superintendent Ybarra is going to be about fixing that problem.”

BOISE – Idaho wasted $61 million on a statewide instructional management system for schools that former state schools Superintendent Tom Luna continued to push despite warnings it wouldn’t work, according to a new state performance evaluation.

BOISE – Idaho wasted $61 million on a statewide instructional management system for schools that former state schools Superintendent Tom Luna continued to push despite warnings it wouldn’t work, according to a new state performance evaluation.

Tim Corder, special assistant to new state schools Superintendent Sherri Ybarra, told lawmakers Tuesday the state performance evaluation report is accurate.

“We really are a changed administration,” Corder told the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee. “It was not us. It was the previous administration. … Superintendent Ybarra did not create that problem, but Superintendent Ybarra is going to be about fixing that problem.”

The report from the Legislature’s Office of Performance Evaluations showed that Idaho spent $61 million trying to implement Schoolnet statewide, including a $21 million grant from the J.A. & Kathryn Albertson Foundation and more than $40 million in state tax funds.

Schoolnet tracks students’ grades, attendance, test scores and curriculum and is available to teachers, parents and schools to track student learning. Many districts never used the system, and only a small number still use it.

The state initially committed $77 million toward the project, including the grant, as part of Luna’s Students Come First school reform initiative. Idaho voters rejected the Students Come First laws in a 2012 referendum. In addition to the statewide instructional management system, the push called for a laptop computer for every Idaho high school student, a new focus on online learning, eliminating teacher contract protections and shifting resources to cover the new expenditures without increasing school funding.

“Poor management, poor decisions and poor system functionality compounded themselves and prevented the goals for a statewide instructional management system from being realized,” Rakesh Mohan, director of the Legislature’s Office of Performance Evaluations, told lawmakers.

Rep. Gayle Batt, R-Wilder, called it “sickening results, if you ask me.” “You see that there’s $61 million, you think, wow, that would have gone a long way for roads,” Batt said.

House Minority Leader John Rusche, D-Lewiston, called the report “disheartening.”

“It seems to be every year we find somebody has a great idea and doesn’t check it out,” Rusche said. “And then, of course, we claim poverty on why we can’t support the teachers or the other services.”

Rusche proposed legislation this year to set up a new Office of Inspector General for Idaho, but the bill hasn’t gotten a hearing.

“We should demand more accountability,” Rusche said. “I haven’t seen that from the executive, thus far, so maybe we should be doing that.”

Corder said one of Ybarra’s top priorities, already approved by legislative budget writers, is adding a person to oversee contracts at the state Department of Education; he said the new administration was surprised to find no one had that role, though the department oversees some 1,500 contracts.

He noted how the department leapt into action to replace the defunct Idaho Education Network statewide contract by helping individual districts select and contract with their own broadband vendors.

“We want to leave you with the message that you can trust the state Department of Education,” Corder said. “You can trust this administration – we can count, we can, and we can calculate, and we can spell. And we can do all of the other things that you require us to do.”

Luna signed two contracts totaling $10.9 million in 2010 and 2011 with NCS Pearson Inc. for Schoolnet, plus an array of other smaller contracts as part of the project. Millions more was spent directly, including on professional development and technology. Pearson was one of three vendors named as finalists for the contract after a request for information issued in January of 2010.

“The problems with the project began long before a system vendor was selected, were rooted in decisions made by the department, and importantly, were for the most part avoidable,” the report found.

Pete Koehler, Ybarra’s chief deputy superintendent and former Nampa School District superintendent, said Schoolnet was never intended to be a statewide system – it was designed to function at the school district level. The report found that the statewide Schoolnet system was “overly ambitious given the capabilities of the product it selected to use.”","US,Project Failure,Government,State/Local,Education,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency"

Agency apologises for problems, says interface between rules engine software and portal is to blame, and insists it is committed to delivering digital systems

The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has blamed the IT problems that have hampered its £154m Rural Payments system on the interface between the rules engine software and the portal.

And in a statement, it reiterated that ""the government is still committed to delivering government systems digitally.""

The system, which is supposed to support online access for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), the European Union's biggest rural payments subsidy scheme for the farming industry, had problems last week, with the RPA telling farmers that although they could register using the system, farmers would be asked to submit Basic Payment Scheme claims on paper forms.

Explaining the problems, a spokesperson for the RPA said: ""The core of the Rural Payments system is working well, but there have been performance problems with the online interface that is supposed to make it easy for farmers and agents to use.

""The problems chiefly revolve around the interface between the portal and the rules engine software. That one area wasn't consistently stable and it was having an adverse effect on the rest of the service. We needed a totally reliable service for farmers to make their claims in time for the deadline. That deadline was too close for us to continue to try and fix this interface problem.""

The spokesperson added, ""We've listened to the concerns of farmers, landowners and our industry partners which is why we're introducing the steps announced yesterday. We are sorry for the frustration caused. Any work done by farmers so far has been stored and will be retained by the RPA as we continue to develop the online Rural Payments system.

""All BPS claims will be made through the system and we will be making improvements to the system as we move ahead. The government is still committed to delivering government systems digitally. Our focus now must be ensuring everyone who wants to can claim on time.""

Today, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs website was still steadfastly promoting the 'Rural Payments' digital service as ""the new way to claim for the basic payment scheme this year.""

It said:

Register and start your 2015 BPS claim now



For your 2015 claim, you'll need to build your claim in stages. Once you've registered, you'll be told when you can complete each stage.

You can't use Government Gateway to access the new service - you'll need to prove who you are over the phone, or using the online method (GOV.UK Verify).

Over the phone

If you call the Rural Payments helpline (03000 200 301) to register, you need to have an email address. You also need to have information about your land and business to hand. The helpline will ask you security questions about your past SPS payments and claims, and information relating to your business.

Online method (GOV.UK Verify)

You can use the new digital route to prove who you are, this is called GOV.UK Verify. You'll need information about your financial history, and a photocard driving licence or passport, it said.

In its statement to Government Computing , the RPA said, ""We're now taking some new steps to ensure that everyone who has registered on the system - that's more than 85% of farm businesses in England - have the help they need to make a claim.



""Today, we'll be emailing all farmers and agents who have registered on the system with more information. For example, we are offering them the option of using the RLE1 ((Rural Land and Entitlements) form that they know well to make their claim.



""If you need to make a simple claim - most likely because your land hasn't changed - we will fast track you through the Rural Payments system because we have most of the information we need. You will be able to complete your claim by email.



""But if your claim is more complex - probably because your land has changed - we will send you a pre populated form in April and you can check it, sign it and then get it back to us by post or at one of our 50 drop-in centres across England.""



It added, ""In the meantime, from Monday we'll put the RLE1 (Rural Land and Entitlements) form - and the Basic Payment Scheme claim form - online so that farmers and their agents can begin preparing their claims next week.""



""We're also looking at how best to offer agents dealing with the most complex cases direct access to the core of the online system - that's the bit that's working well.""

Rutherford County first contracted with GSA in 1989 for a court-management computer system. (Photo: File photo)

After investing two years and almost $1 million to update Rutherford County's antiquated court-management computer system, a new Circuit Court clerk pulled the plug.

Now the county, clerk's office and software company are all standing around with fingers pointed, wanting to find out what went wrong and whether a lawsuit might be around the corner.

Because of the threat of pending litigation, few would talk about what exactly happened when New Dawn Technology and the Rutherford County government tried to move the county's judicial system into the 21st century.

Attorney Evan Cope, who represents Rutherford County in the matter, said the county is working on a solution with New Dawn and that no Rutherford County official can publicly comment about the situation.

A spokesman for New Dawn Technologies or its parent company could also not be reached for comment after multiple attempts.

Also multiple attempts to contact attorney Terry Fann, who represents Circuit Court Clerk Melissa Harrell, failed to bring a response.

But since the system briefly went live last September, the inquiries have been building from the public and elected officials about what happened with the project that spanned more than two years and two Circuit Court clerks.

""I've had more questions about this issue than anything else since I've been on the commission,"" said Rutherford County Commissioner Robert Stevens. ""They just want to know what's going on.""

To help find out what's going on, through an open records request, The Daily News Journal examined thousands of emails sent between Office of Information Technology officials about the New Dawn project from late 2012 to early 2015.

The DNJ's investigation found problems tied to the Rutherford County Circuit Court clerk's office and New Dawn's court management system lingered and compounded in the months when the product was developed before an implementation filled with bugs and slip-ups led to its abandonment by Harrell, just a few months after taking office.

County officials first embraced the project with high hopes that new software would jettison an outdated court software that still operates on dot-matrix printers, which became obsolete when Bill Clinton was president, and requires lawyers, law enforcement officials and members of the public to pull paper files for every court case in the county.

""This should have been the single most positive change to Rutherford County in 40 years,"" said former Circuit Court Clerk Laura Bohling in an interview with The DNJ. ""It would have made the legal process — the background of the legal process — more accessible to most people.""

Once implemented, the system was said to give an office that had avoided upgrades for decades the ability to move to the front of the county's digital push in advance of the opening of the new judicial building. County commissioners approved the purchase of the New Dawn program in September 2012.

""The idea was that we would eventually become a paper-fewer — because there's no way the court system is going to become paperless — or a digital-based office,"" Bohling said.

After the system was implemented, county officials said the annual cost of maintaining the system would be lower than Government Services Automated, the software company that the office previously used, because other departments could access and assemble reports from court data without paying for the program.

GSA cost the county a combined $126,138 in 2012, while the New Dawn system was to cost around $65,000 three years after it was implemented. The only costs other departments would incur would be if they wanted to input their own data into the system.

The projected savings and jump in technology was enough for the entire County Commission to support funding the $737,786 software project through its capital budget. In all, the county spent more than $902,000 for the software and hardware upgrades needed for the new system.

""It sounded like a good deal to move forward on,"" Stevens said.

That optimism was abundant when county and New Dawn officials signed a contract to develop the new program Sept. 28, 2012.

Problems, delays start

But that's when the problems started.

The agreement needed revisions hours after it was signed — the date of the contract was a year off. It took nearly two weeks for both parties to alter the contract date and for the county to make its first payment to the Utah-based company.

The clerk's office and OIT had already hired Wilkie Buchanan to manage the project full time before he moved recently to other tech projects within county government.

The estimated dates of completion were also changed when it became clear what had to be done to transition from the GSA programs to modern software.

By January 2013, project officials got the green light to start the planning phase and found the server system was not adequate to perform the installations.

""Of course, this is after the fact that we got their blessing to proceed with the plan that was submitted,"" Buchanan said in an email.

Weekly updates published throughout development outlined the risks and delays that came with converting data from the system described as archaic. Other parts of the project, including creating unified payment methods or the input of state criminal charges and fines, also became behind schedule.

""If we use the timeline provided in the contract SOW (scope of work), we are looking at a Go Live that is barreling closer and closer to 2014,"" Bohling said in a January 2013 email to Buchanan. ""If we cannot accelerate any of the phases, then I am projecting, at best, a November Go Live… in reality, more like January or February. That's bad.""

Buchanan later said he would do everything he could to get the system ready before the primary elections. The system went live four months after the May primaries.

Those delayed deadlines weren't met either as the staff still struggled to get data from GSA or assemble the costs and fines for different offenses in the state's legal system.

Organizers were still trying to get on the same page as an end-of-year start date continued to advance on them.

The actual cost of the program was also coming into focus by then, including which departments would have to bear the most cost. In an email sent to Brian Robertson, OIT director, and Buchanan, Bohling said she was surprised about an additional to her department, but she said she was willing to bear that cost to update her county's software system.

""One of the things philosophically that I will not support is modifying this plan to be less expensive if that means ending up with something 'cheaper,'"" Bohling said in a May 2013 email, ""as in typical government cost cutting that results in generational waste and challenges.""

By summer 2013, New Dawn officials said they learned that elements like invoices, payroll and excess fees were even going to be part of the project.

New Dawn also received additional responsibilities from the county to manage the project at the same time, though the scope of the first phase of the project was eventually reduced. In early 2014, project managers had scrapped electronic filing from initial implementation and delayed it to the project's second phase.

""The issue with getting the financial into JustWare was known in the beginning, but neither party knew that they were going to be on this scale,"" Buchanan said weeks after the implementation.

Political changes

Laura Bohling (Photo: File)

The problems with system's development led into a Republican primary in May 2014 where technology and New Dawn became campaign issues, Bohling said.

Harrell defeated Bohling by nearly 900 votes as the incumbent finished last in a three-person race.

The technology program that Bohling had championed would remain ready to launch even after her defeat. Even if she had remained in office, she said the transition to it would not have been simple.

""I think the perception was that you'd turn a switch on and it would be perfect right when it started,"" Bohling said. ""I said every time it wasn't going to be perfect right from the start. There's no software that's going to be perfect.""

A combination of Harrell's primary win and additional delays led to a go-live date just after Labor Day — the first day of the new clerk's term.

The start was eventually delayed by another week, so the staff could undergo additional training.

In the weeks after the program went live, emails buzzed between county and New Dawn officials about the glitches that arose.

Notes were sent back and forth about individual lines concerning errors on circuit court dockets, phantom charges on the criminal court cases or how to determine workarounds with the system.

Even with months of training on the new system, backlogs quickly developed in several justice-system offices. Procedures took longer than under the old system. Some courts could not issue checks for child support or restitation for weeks after implementation.

By Oct. 24 — seven weeks after initial implementation — there was discussion about whether to abandon the New Dawn system and consider alternatives.

""I personally warned Laura Bohling that there was a fairly high degree of risk with New Dawn, and that if she wanted to go the safer, maybe not as exciting route, she needed to choose TnCIS (Tennessee Court Information System),"" Robertson's email to Harrell read. ""She made the decision to go with New Dawn, not OIT. She managed the migration with a heavy hand, even doing things differently than we recommended at several critical points.""

Bohling defended the software program and her handling of its implementation, saying that New Dawn offered a more expansive system than other options. Given the volume of the data and the program, she said the implementation was expected to be done in phases.

""New Dawn was not inherently more risky than any of the other products we bid, but would be more of a risk than a more narrowly focused product,"" she said. ""The benefits, however, far outweighed the risks.""

That difference between the New Dawn and GSA systems were made clear again when the county decided they were better off returning to their old system.

GSA contract extended

An agreement was reached in November to extend the contract of the GSA system previously used by the clerk's office.

After months of work and hundreds of thousands of county dollars spent, the Rutherford County Circuit Court clerk was back to the dot-matrix printers and paper filings they first used 25 years ago.

In front of the Rutherford County Budget, Finance & Investment Committee in November, Rutherford County Mayor Ernest Burgess said the New Dawn system had failed to perform to that point and might not meet expectations at all.

""There's enough information flowing to all of us to give us great pause whether we can be successful in this system,"" Burgess told the committee.

The county officially gave New Dawn notice of the dissatisfaction with its product in February.

The county is now moving toward a pair of options involving New Dawn and its abandoned system, Stevens said — work with the company to try to repair the software or sue them and try to get some of the money back that the county spent.

The language of the dispute strikes a different tone than county employees used to describe New Dawn in the lead-up to the new court-management system.

Bohling and OIT employees said New Dawn provided more than necessary help during the development process.

""They went above and beyond as far as going outside the context of our contract, giving us more services than we actually had contracted with them for,"" Bohling said. ""They always engaged with us on a very one-on-one level.""

The engagement will have to continue between the two companies, Stevens said, for any type of resolution to occur.

""We're either going to get this system to work, or we're going to have to go to court to try to get some of our money back,"" Stevens said.

Stevens believes the county will have a sense of what direction the dispute will take in a matter of weeks.

The timing, Bohling said, should allow the program she believes is still feasible a chance to work.

""It is really beyond the time of finding reasons why it didn't work,"" Bohling said. ""It's time to make it work.""

With no apparent end in sight to the problems, Ontario is now giving an additional $5 million to municipalities that continue to rack up bills for overtime and training related to the province’s troubled welfare caseload computer system.

The announcement Thursday brings the total of additional money the province has had to pay out for SAMS-related costs such as training, overtime, and additional hires for Ontario Works and the Ontario Disability Support Program, to roughly $21 million.

That doesn’t include the $242 million the province paid in project development costs for the system.

SAMS (Social Assistance Management System), a large computer software program from IBM that rolled out last November, manages case files and payments for more than half a million social assistance recipients in Ontario. Caseworkers across the province use SAMS to manage client files.

But glitches and major operating issues with the system are creating nightmares and longer workdays for those caseworkers.

Thursday’s announcement came after municipal managers across the province stepped up demands for funds to cover the full costs for “service impacts’’ stemming from SAMS.

On Monday, the city of Ottawa’s deputy city manager Steve Kanellakos released a damning report that estimated the city will need $4 million to manage service impacts from SAMS.

That was about $3.5 million short of what the province had promised that city.

“With the failure of SAMS to keep up with regular business, there has been a major strain’’ on social services staff in Ottawa, Kanellakos said in his report.

“SAMS has introduced a layer of time and complexity that is extremely challenging,’’ he added.

The problems have been consistent throughout the province. The worst setback came in late November shortly after the system’s launch, when SAMS assigned overpayments totalling $20 million to 17,000 clients, some of which the province and its municipalities continue to scramble to recover.

The system has also caused some clients to receive little or none of their social assistance.

In February the province announced up to $300,000 for an independent review to look into problems with SAMS.

A special technical working group, consisting of municipal and provincial front-line workers, managers and technical staff, was also put in place to figure out ways to improve the computer system.

The funds announced Thursday are for SAMS problems on the Ontario Works side, and will come out of the ministry of Community and Social Service’s existing social assistance administration budget, Amber Anderson, press secretary for Community and Social Services Minister Helena Jaczek, said in a statement Thursday.

“While SAMS is improving social assistance in Ontario, its implementation has had challenges and must be improved. In the first year of introducing a new technology there will be additional operating costs such as staff overtime as we work with our delivery partners to fully normalize use of the new platform.”

On March 4, OMSSA (Ontario Municipal Social Services Association), which represents municipal workers, commissioners, and managers in the province, sent a letter to assistant deputy minister Richard Steele outlining ongoing problems with SAMS and stating “our members’ requests for 100 per cent compensation (for SAMS-related service impacts) has not changed.’’

In a statement after the new funding was announced Thursday, OMSSA spokesperson Petra Wolfbeiss called the $5 million “good news’’ but added: “I wish we could say that we see the light at the end of the tunnel, but unfortunately we are still very much in the middle of trying to figure out how SAMS will support staff in working with clients to the best extent possible.’’

New Democrat MPP Cindy Forster, her party’s Community and Social Services critic, took aim at the announcement, saying “municipalities shouldn’t be on the hook for the government’s mishandling of the SAMS system, and neither should Ontarians.

“This government knew full well that the SAMS system wasn’t ready, but they rolled it out anyway,’’ leaving dedicated case workers stuck “cleaning up the mess’’ Forster added.","Canada,Operational Failure,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,$,Impact - Raw,Impact - Qty,Impact - Currency"
future,Australia spending AU$800 million to upgrade & consolidate ADF IT data centres over the next ten years, Project started in September 2014 ,,,,,,,,,AUD,Australia,,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,http://www.zdnet.com/article/defence-launches-au800m-it-upgrade-project/,true,Defence launches AU$800m IT upgrade project,"The Australian Department of Defence has launched a project to streamline its vast, cumbersome, and expensive computer system.

The project has the potential to save Defence almost AU$2 billion over 10 years, by consolidating 280 datacentres to 11 domestic and three international centres.

Defence has one of the largest information and communications technology systems in Australia, with around 100,000 users.

The centralised processing project will consolidate infrastructure and applications, ensuring more efficient and modern systems.

An effective system was essential to Defence's readiness to conduct all of its operations, including responses to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief both at home and abroad, Defence Minister David Johnston said in a statement.

Johnston added that there had been ""insufficient capital investment"" for Defence IT for several years.

""The aim is to establish a single, integrated capability for the management and provision of datacentre facilities, infrastructure, and services at the Unclassified, Restricted, and Secret information security domain levels,"" the minister said.

The AU$800 million project will be managed by Lockheed Martin.","Australia,,Government,National,Defense and Veterans Affairs,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency"
future,Australia announces AU$1B - $1.5 Billion Plan to Modernize 40 year-old Welfare Payment Systems, Time frame to be announced later this year ,,,,,,,,,AUD,Australia,,Government,State/Local,Health and Human Services,,"http://www.itnews.com.au/News/383698,hockey-flags-billion-dollar-centrelink-mainframe-replacement.aspx",true,Hockey flags billion-dollar Centrelink mainframe replacement,"Claims 30 year-old tech is holding Govt back.

The federal government has ""no choice"" but to modernise the critical systems underpinning Centrelink's 30-year old mainframe, despite the likelihood of the project costing in excess of a billion dollars, Treasurer Joe Hockey said today.

Hockey, who served as Human Services Minister in the Howard Government, was quizzed about whether the Government could afford the expense of upgrading the ageing IT infrastructure this morning by 3AW radio’s Neil Mitchell.

“We have to do it,” he answered. “The question is how we will do it and how we will ensure that we improve service delivery into the future.”

He did not offer any indication of if and when a funding commitment might be forthcoming.

Centrelink's Model 204 database management system was set up in 1983 and is currently licensed to the agency by Computer Corporation of America (CCA) under a ten year, $98.5 million contract.

Hockey said the system, which supports Centrelink’s core Income Support Integrated System (ISIS), is “ageing and it is in bad shape”.

“My overwhelming concern is that it is inhibiting the capacity of the government, to some degree, to roll out policy that properly addresses problems in the economy and in the budget.

“Centrelink and the Pentagon in the US are the only two customers in the world of this one company that maintains the Centrelink mainframe, which is extraordinary.""

iTnews understands the Treasuer’s billion-dollar price tag is more or less in keeping with departmental estimates of the cost of the project, which some anticipate would reach slightly over $1 billion.

The debate over what to do about Model 204 has raged within the public service for many years, and is centred around the complexities involved with the upgrade and the vast volumes of code that underpin the dozens of welfare programs the system supports.

Last November, Human Services CIO Gary Sterrenberg told iTnews he was well aware of the problems, but was in no rush to migrate off a system he called a “soldier”.

Eventually, he said, DHS would have to reassess what was available on the market but would not rule out moving to a newer version on Model 204 if CCA was to offer it.

Sources suggest DHS is acutely aware of the potentially lengthy period of time any replacement would take, and the need to start early.

Small scale migrations of peripheral systems to ISIS onto SAP are understood to already be taking place within DHS.

The complexity involved in such a task is also overwhelming – similar to changing the engines on a plane while it is still flying, according to one insider – and would almost certainly result in disruptions to welfare services.

future,Oregon Is Spending 4 years and $81 Million to replace tax systems, Project began in November 2014 ,,,,,,,,,USD,US,,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,http://portlandtribune.com/pt/9-news/233665-98613-revenue-agency-to-replace-computers,true,Revenue agency to replace computers,"The Oregon Department of Revenue is set to launch a four-year replacement of its computer systems that will improve its capacity to track payments and collect taxes.

Lawmakers were told Tuesday that the first phase, which will affect corporate and tobacco taxes, will start on Nov. 12.

The total cost is estimated at $81 million over four years. But the first phase is coming in at one-third less than the budgeted amount of $31 million for this two-year cycle, says Eric Smith, the agency official leading the project.

The agency’s core computer systems date back to 1993.

Unlike other state information technology projects that have been snarled in problems, among them the Cover Oregon website for the state’s health insurance exchange, this project will not involve developing anything new.

The new system will be supplied by Fast Enterprises, a Colorado-based software company that has provided similar systems for 17 other agencies. Quality assurance will be overseen by CSG Government Solutions, based in Chicago.

“I have more confidence than I had expected to,” says Sen. Elizabeth Steiner Hayward, D-Portland, who sits on the general government subcommittee of the Legislative Emergency Board.

“I think this is a model for how a huge information technology project should run.”

Catching delinquencies

In addition to improving efficiency, the new system will enable the agency to participate fully in the Treasury Offset Program of the U.S. Treasury, which aims at catching those owing taxes.

“More than anything else, what’s needed here are information system upgrades at Oregon’s Department of Revenue,” writes Fred Thompson, a professor at the Atkinson Graduate School of Management at Willamette University.

Thompson made his comments a year ago on the Oregon Economics blog maintained by Oregon State University.

Financing of the new system will come from the tax-supported general fund and bonds. Of the $81 million budgeted, $65 million is for implementation, $9 million for financing costs, and $7 million for readiness.

In the next phases, records of personal income taxes and senior property tax deferrals will be upgraded in 2015, withholding payments and payroll taxes in 2016, and other tax programs in 2017.

2012 incident

Lawmakers have been watching the project carefully for other reasons.

Shortly after long-time manager Jim Bucholz was named agency director in May 2012, Krystle Reyes pleaded guilty to felony theft and tax fraud in connection with filing a false $2.1 million refund. She was sentenced in Marion County Circuit Court to five and a half years in prison.

One agency employee was demoted and three others disciplined in connection with approving the refund, which had been flagged by an agency computer. No one was dismissed.

The new system would allow for quicker comparisons of returns, an agency spokesman said at the time.

The agency had asked to start the replacement project in the 2013-15 budget, but withdrew its request during the 2013 session. Lawmakers finally gave a go-ahead in May.","US,,Government,State/Local,Finance and Treasury,,,Impact - Raw,Impact - Currency"
future,First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) to spend $7 billion by 2022 to implement national broadband network for first reponders," Project began in 2012; FirstNet chairwoman Susan Swenson stated ""We should be shot"" if system isn't working by 2022 ",,,,,,,,,USD,US,,Government,National,Law Enforcement,,http://www.nextgov.com/mobile/2015/03/national-broadband-network-first-responders-hits-roadblocks/107526/,true,"If First Responder Broadband Network Isn’t Working by 2022, ‘We Should be Shot,’ Program Director Says","Despite a spate of public emergencies in recent years -- Hurricane Sandy, the Boston Marathon bombing and a mudslide in Washington state last year -- it will be several more years until police officers, firefighters and others can access the federally funded, nationwide broadband network being built for first responders.

With a $7 billion budget, the First Responder Network Authority, known as FirstNet, is overseen by the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Three years after the establishment of the FirstNet team, the project has encountered regulatory obstacles that could delay further progress -- a slow hiring process and management challenges, among others.

During a recent Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committee hearing on the topic, lawmakers expressed concern that the national project -- designed to help first responders communicate with each other during emergencies -- may be too ambitious to pull off.

In an opening statement, committee chairman Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., cautioned the FirstNet team to learn from other large federal IT projects.

""One commentator recently asked whether FirstNet is on a path to becoming the next 'Healthcare.gov,'"" Thune said, referring to the federal health insurance website's botched rollout. But he added, ""the challenge of setting up this network is arguably many times greater.""

Thune also noted that FirstNet needed to be self-sufficient, as the federal budget couldn't tolerate spending more than $7 billion. (The FirstNet team plans to generate revenue from user fees and auction some of its spectrum. During the hearing, FirstNet chairwoman Susan Swenson assured the committee she was not looking for money.)

In response to several senators' questions about how the team could ensure FirstNet reached rural areas, Swenson said rural coverage is “as high a priority as urban"". She added that the group is currently consulting with state representatives to ""give an opportunity for folks in the state to tell us where the priorities are.""

When Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., asked if the network would be secure against cyberthreats, Swenson answered FirstNet was ""collaborating very closely"" with the Department of Homeland Security.

But recent reports find problems in FirstNet's management of the nationwide project. In December, the Commerce Department’s inspector general released a report about FirstNet’s ethics and procurement practices, finding that the group’s board members did not file timely public financial disclosures and that its contracting practices lacked transparency, oversight and procedures to prevent erroneous costs.

During the hearing, Mark Goldstein, the Government Accountability Office's director of physical infrastructure issues, shared preliminary findings from a FirstNet audit.

“They have to take more time, focus more attention on certain kinds of management issues, such as ensuring there are codes, standards of conduct, by which people will be measured,"" Goldstein said in an interview. ""We didn't feel they were doing as good a job as possible in working through the risk matrix and understanding how various challenges they face could potentially undermine their mission.""

Trying to develop a wireless broadband network that doesn't cost a lot of money, and that first responders will actually use, he said, is a ""pretty tall order.""

The group is also stymied by hiring challenges, Swenson said, noting that background checks and other regulatory barriers mean it can take up to 10 months to hire new employees at FirstNet.

With a sluggish hiring process, and without direct authority to hire, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said “there is simply no way you can compete for the limited pool of highly skilled talented people who are being hired by Google [and] Apple. There is high demand for these people and you’re telling them, ‘Sorry, we can’t let you know for another 10 months,’ and they’re going to say, ‘Thanks, but no thanks.'""

By not removing regulatory obstacles to hiring, he added, “the federal government is failing you.”

Challenges notwithstanding, Swenson said, FirstNet is on track to consider a draft request for proposals toward the end of March, so a final request for proposals can be issued toward the end of the calendar year.

And when Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., asked if the FirstNet team could have the program operational by 2022, Swenson answered, “If we don’t, we should be shot.""
