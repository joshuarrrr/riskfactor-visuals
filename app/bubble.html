            <p>Governments in many parts of the world have embarked on IT modernization efforts, either replacing a legacy IT system or combining a large number of systems into one. In the United States, several states have tried and failed to improve their various social welfare and unemployment systems. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Defense has been trying to modernize its payroll and logistical systems, which has led to billions of dollars in project cancellations and cost overruns. The United Kingdom has also seen a number of costly governmental IT infrastructure modernization projects go off the rails as well, like the National Identity Register project, which was scrapped in 2010 at a cost of £257 million (about US $394 million).</p>
