Though it’s arguable whether there were relatively more IT failures than in the past (after all, the digitization of society has increased over the past decade), it does seem that there are more consequentially larger failures than before.</p><p>Looking at the history of project failures since 2005, one can uncover a couple of reasons why large IT project failures have become more common. First, governments in many parts of the world have embarked on IT modernization efforts, either by replacing an existing legacy IT system or by combining a large number of legacy IT systems into a single system.  For instance, the US Federal government has provided monetary incentives to the states to improve their various social welfare and unemployment systems. Several states have not managed these modernization efforts very well, with California, Colorado,  Indiana,  Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Tennessee and Wisconsin among others experiencing project troubles.  Similarly, the US Department of Defense has been trying to modernize its payroll and logistical systems, which has led to billions of dollars in project cancellations and cost overruns; something that its defense counterpart in the UK has experienced on a smaller scale as well. The UK has also seen a number of costly governmental IT infrastructure modernization project go off the rails as well, too.</p><p>The governmental push for the increased use of health information technology has also led to a number of major IT project fiascoes in Australia, the United Kingdom and the US.  The UK’s attempt to create a national electronic health record system, for instance, ended up being finally canceled in 2012 after more than £11 billion was spent, whereas the plan to make the electronic health records between the US DoD and Veterans Administration came to naught after spending $1.3 billion. The passage of the Affordable Care Act of 2009 – aka Obamacare – also led to some spectacular health IT project failures in Hawaii, Oregon, Maryland and Massachusetts, not to mention to major problems at the Federal level.</p><p>There have also been some spectacular operational IT failures over the past ten years, especially in the financial community. Banks in both Australia and the UK have repeatedly experienced major IT outages due to under-investment in their IT infrastructures.  For example, in 2010, 8 million customers of National Australia Bank found that they had no access to their accounts for days, while 6 million of customers of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group in the UK and Ireland experienced the same problem in 2012. Some RBS Group customers didn’t have access to their accounts for weeks.</p><p>Stock exchanges around the world have also seen their share of operational difficulties as well, with have been problems in Tokyo, Singapore, London, Mumbai, Toronto, Chicago and New York. The NYSE experienced a flash crash in 2010 which saw the market drop almost 1000 points and then rebound within minutes, while a rogue algorithm led to market maker Knight Capital to lose $440 million in errant trades about 45 minutes in 2012.</p><p>Airlines also experienced their share of problems as they modernized their reservation systems, especially after mergers. As we mentioned, the merger of reservation systems of US Airways and American West led to a major meltdown in 2007. United Airlines suffered a major reservation system meltdown when it merged its reservation system with Continental’s in 2012. Australia’s Virgin Blue’s new reservation system also had a rocky debut in 2010. And lest we forget, British Airways automated baggage handling system at its new Terminal 5 went into a major meltdown on its debut in 2008.</p><p>There are a number of major IT projects that will prove interesting to watch in the future. These include Australia’s AU$1.5 billion plan to modernize its welfare payments system, New Zealand’s $1 billion tax system modernization, and the US $7 billion effort to implement a national broadband network for first responders. FirstNet chairwoman Susan Swenson stated, “We should be shot,” if system isn&#39;t working by as planned by 2022.
